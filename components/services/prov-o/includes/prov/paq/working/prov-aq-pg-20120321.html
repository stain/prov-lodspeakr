    <section id='abstract'>
This document specifies how to use standard Web protocols,
including HTTP, to obtain information about the provenance of Web
resources. We describe both simple access mechanisms for
locating provenance information associated with web pages or resources, and
provenance query services for more complex deployments. This is
part of the larger W3C Prov provenance framework.
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
      This document is part of a set of specifications produced by the W3C provenance working group aiming to define interoperable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.  It describes the use of existing web mechanisms for discovery and retrieval of provenance information. 
    </section>

<!-- == Sect 1 =================================================================================== -->
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Provenance Data Model [[PROV-DM]] and Provenance Ontology [[PROV-O]] specifications define how to represent provenance information in the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        This note describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance information:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Simple mechanisms for retrieving and discovering provenance information are described in <a href="#accessing-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#locating-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a> .
          </li>
          <li>
            More advanced discovery service and query mechanisms that may be used for more demanding deployments are described in <a href="#provenance-services" class="sectionRef"></a>, <a href="#querying-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#incremental-provenance-retrieval" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          In defining the specification below, we make use of the following concepts. 
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>Provenance information</dfn></dt>
            <dd>refers to provenance represented in some fashion.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Provenance-URI</dfn></dt>
            <dd>a URI denoting some <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a>.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Entity</dfn></dt>
            <dd>an aspect of a <a class="internalDFN">resource</a>, about which one wishes to present some <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a>. For example, a weather report for a given date may be an aspect of a resource that is maintained as the current weather report. An entity is itself a <a class="internalDFN">resource</a>.  See also [[PROV-DM]], and [[WEBARCH]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#representation-reuse">section 2.3.2</a>.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Entity-URI</dfn></dt>
            <dd>a URI denoting an <a class="internalDFN">entity</a>, which allows that entity to be identified for the purpose of finding and expressing <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> (see <a href="#provenance-entities-resources" class="sectionRef"></a> for discussion)</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Provenance service</dfn></dt>
            <dd>a service that provides <class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> given a <a class="internalDFN">resource</a> URI or an <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a>.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Service-URI</dfn></dt>
            <dd>the URI of a <a class="internalDFN">provenance service</a>.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>Resource</dfn></dt>
            <dd>also referred to as <dfn>web resource</dfn>: a resource as described by the Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]], <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#id-resources">section 2.2</a>. A resource may be associated with multiple <a title="Entity" class="internalDFN">entities</a> (see <a href="#provenance-entities-resources" class="sectionRef"></a> for discussion)</dd>
          </dl>
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="provenance-entities-resources">Provenance, entities and resources</h2>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> is <em>about</em> <a class="internalDFN">resources</a>.  In general, resources may vary over time and context.  E.g., a resource describing the weather in London changes from day-to-day, or one listing restaurants near you will vary depending on your location.  Provenance information, to be useful, must be persistent and not itself dependent on context.  Yet we may still want to make provenance assertions about dynamic or context-dependent web resources (e.g. the weather forecast for London on a particular day may have been derived from a particular set of Meteorological Office data).
        </p>
        <p>
          Provenance descriptions of dynamic and context-dependent resources are possible through the notion of entities.  An <a class="internalDFN">entity</a> is simply a resource (in the sense defined by [[WEBARCH]], <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#id-resources">section 2.2</a>) that is a contextualized view or instance of an original resource.  For example, a W3C specification typically undergoes several public revisions before it is finalized.  A URI that refers to the "current" revision might be thought of as denoting the specification through its lifetime.  Separate URIs for each individual revision would then be <a class="internalDFN">entity-URIs</a>, denoting the specification at a particular stage in its development.  Using these, we can make provenance assertions that a particular revision was published on a particular date, and was last modified by a particular editor.  Entity-URIs may use any URI scheme, and are not required to be dereferencable.
        </p>
        <p>
           Requests for provenance about a resource may return provenance information that uses one or more entity-URIs to refer to versions of that resource.  Some given provenance information may use multiple entity-URIs if there are assertions referring to the same underlying resource in different contexts.  For example, provenance information describing a W3C document might include information about all revisions of the document using statements that use the different entity-URIs of the various revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, a key notion within the concepts outlined above is that <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> may be not universally applicable to a <a class="internalDFN">resource</a>, but may be expressed with respect to that resource in a restricted context (e.g. at a particular time). This restricted view is called an <a class="internalDFN">entity</a>, and an <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a> is used to refer to it within provenance information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Interpreting provenance information</h2>
        <p><a class="internalDFN">Provenance information</a> describes relationships between entities, activities and agents.  As such, any given provenance information may contain information about several <a title="Entity" class="internalDFN">entities</a>.  Within some provenance information, the entities thus described are identified by their <a class="internalDFN">Entity-URI</a>s.
        </p>
        <p>When interpreting provenance information, it is important to be aware that statements about several entities may be present, and to be accordingly selective when using the information provided.  (In some exceptional cases, it may be that the provenance information returned does not contain any information relating to a specific associated entity.)
        </p>
      </section>

    </section>
 
<!-- == Sect 2 =================================================================================== -->
    
    <section>
      <h2>Accessing provenance information</h2>
      <p>Web applications may access <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> in the same way as any web resource, by dereferencing its URI. Thus, any provenance information may be associated with a <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a>, and may be accessed by dereferencing that URI using web mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much or how little provenance information is returned in response to a retrieval request is a matter for the provenance provider application.  
      </p>
      <p>
      It may be useful to provide provenance information through a service interface. A REST protocol for provenance retrieval is defined in Section <a href="#provenance-services" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    When publishing provenance information, the location of that information either at a URI or within a Service should be discoverable using one or more of the mechanisms described in <a href="#locating-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    
      

    </section>
 
<!-- == Sect 3 =================================================================================== -->
    
    <section>
      <h2>Locating provenance information</h2>
      <p>
        When <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> is a resource that can be accessed using web retrieval, one needs to know a <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a> to dereference.  If this is known in advance, there is nothing more to specify.  If a provenance-URI is not known then a mechanism to discover one must be based on information that is available to the would-be accessor. Likewise, provenance information may be exposed by a service. In this case, the <a class="internalDFN">Service-URI</a> needs to be known. 
      </p>
      <p>Provenance information about a resource may be provided by several parties other than the provider of that resource, each using different locations, and each with different concerns.  (It is possible that these different parties may provide contradictory provenance information.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Once provenance information about a resource is retrieved, one also needs to know how to locate the view of that resource within that provenance information. This view is an <a class="internalDFN">entity</a> and is identified by an <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start by considering mechanisms for the resource provider to indicate a <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a> or <a class="internalDFN">Service-URI</a>along with a <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a>.  
        
        Three mechanisms are described here:
        <ul>
          <li>The requester knows the resource URI <em>and</em> the resource is accessible using HTTP</li>
          <li>The requester has a copy of a resource represented as HTML or XHTML</li>
          <li>The requester has a copy of a resource represented as RDF (including the range of possible RDF syntaxes, such as HTML with embedded RDFa)</li>
        </ul>
        These particular cases are selected as corresponding to primary current web protocol and data formats.  Finally, in <a href="#arbitrary-data" class="sectionRef"></a>, we discuss the case of a resource in an unspecified format which has been provided by some means other than HTTP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanisms specified for use with HTTP and HTML are similar to those proposed by POWDER [[POWDER-DR]] (sections <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-powder-dr-20090901/#assoc-markup">4.1.1</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-powder-dr-20090901/#httplink">4.1.3</a>).
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Resource accessed by HTTP</h2>
        <p>
          For a document accessible using HTTP, provenance information may be indicated using an HTTP <code>Link</code> header field, as defined by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Web Linking (RFC 5988)</a> [[LINK-REL]].  The <code>Link</code> header field is included in the HTTP response to a GET or HEAD operation (other HTTP operations are not excluded, but are not considered here).
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>provenance</code> link relation type for referencing provenance information is registered according to the template in <a href="#iana-considerations" class="sectionRef"></a>, and may be used as shown::
          <pre class="pattern">Link: <cite>provenance-URI</cite>; rel="provenance"; anchor="<cite>entity-URI</cite>"</pre>
          When used in conjunction with an HTTP success response code (<code>2xx</code>), this HTTP header field indicates that <code><cite>provenance-URI</cite></code> is the URI of some provenance information associated with the requested resource and that the associated entity is identified within the referenced provenance information as <code><cite>entity-URI</cite></code>. (See also <a href="#interpreting-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
        If no <code>anchor</code> link is provided then the <code><cite>entity-URI</cite></code> is assumed to be the URI of the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time, the meaning of these links returned with other HTTP response codes is not defined: future revisions of this specification may define interpretations for these.
        </p>
        <p>
          An HTTP response MAY include multiple <code>provenance</code> link header fields, indicating a number of different provenance resources that are known to the responding server, each providing provenance information about the accessed resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of a <code>provenance</code> link in an HTTP response does not preclude the possibility that other publishers may offer provenance information about the same resource.  In such cases, discovery of the additional provenance information must use other means (e.g. see <a href="#provenance-services" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Provenance resources indicated in this way are not guaranteed to be authoritative.  Trust in the linked provenance information must be determined separately from trust in the original resource, just as in the web at large, it is a users' responsibility to determine an appropriate level of trust in any other linked resource; e.g. based on the domain that serves it, or an associated digital signature.  (Ssee also <a href="#security-considerations" class="sectionRef"></a>.)

              The document provider may indicate that provenance information about the document is provided by a <a class="internalDFN">provenance service</a>. This is done through the use of a <code>provenance-service</code> link relation type following the same pattern as above:
            </p>
            <pre class="pattern">
Link: <cite>provenance-service-URI</cite>; anchor="<cite>entity-URI</cite>"; rel="provenance-service"</pre>
            <p>
              The <code>provenance-service</code> link identifies the <a class="internalDFN">service-URI</a>.  Dereferencing this URI yields a service description that provides further information to enable a client to determine a <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a> or retrieve <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> for an <a class="internalDFN">entity</a>; see <a href="#provenance-services" class="sectionRef"></a> for more details.

            <p>
            There may be multiple <code>provenance-service</code> link header fields, and these may appear in an HTTP response together with <code>provenance</code> link header fields (though, in simple cases, we anticipate that <code>provenance</code> and <code>provenance-service</code> link relations will not be used together).

        <h2>Resource represented as HTML</h2>
        <p>
          For a document presented as HTML or XHTML, without regard for how it has been obtained, provenance information may be associated with a resource by adding a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> element to the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
          Two new link relation types for referencing provenance information are registered according to the template in <a href="#iana-considerations" class="sectionRef"></a>, and may be used as shown:
          <pre class="pattern">

     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;

     &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code><cite>provenance-URI</cite></code> given by the <code>provenance</code> link element identifies the provenance-URI for the document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code><cite>entity-URI</cite></code> given by the <code>anchor</code> link element specifies an specifies an identifier for the entity that may be used within the provenance information when referring to the document.
        </p>
        <p>
          An HTML document header MAY include multiple "provenance" link elements, indicating a number of different provenance resources that are known to the creator of the document, each of which may provide provenance information about the document. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, the header MAY include multiple "anchor" link elements indicating that, e.g., different revisions of the document can be identified in the provenance information using the different  <code><cite>entity-URIs</cite></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        If no "anchor" link element is provided then the <code><cite>entity-URI</cite></code> is assumed to be the URI of the document. It is RECOMMENDED that this convention be used only when the document is static.

        <h2>Resource represented as RDF</h2>
        <p>
          If a resource is represented as RDF (in any of its recognized syntaxes, including RDFa), it may contain references to its own provenance using additional RDF statements.  For this purpose three new RDF properties, <code>prov:hasProvenance</code>, <code>prov:hasAnchor</code>, and <code>prov:hasProvenanceService</code>, are defined in the following.
          (These terms may be used to indicate provenance of other resources too, but discussion of such usage is beyond the scope of this section.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The RDF property <code>prov:hasProvenance</code> is defined as a relation between two resources, where the object of the property is a resource that provides provenance information about the subject resource.  Multiple <code>prov:hasProvenance</code> assertions may be made about a subject resource.  This property corresponds to a <a href="#registration-template-for-link-relation---provenance">"provenance" link relation</a> used with an HTTP <code>Link</code> header field, or HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Property <code>prov:hasAnchor</code> specifies an <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a> used in the provenance information to refer to the RDF document.
          This corresponds to use of the "anchor" parameter in an HTTP "provenance" <code>Link</code> header field, or an <a href="#registration-template-for-link-relation---anchor">"anchor" link relation</a> in an HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, which similarly indicate a URI used by the provenance information to refer to the described document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Property <code>prov:hasProvenanceService</code> specifies a <a class="internalDFN">service-URI</a>s associated with the RDF document for possible access to provenance information.  This property corresponds to a <a href="#registration-template-for-link-relation---provenance-service">"provenance-service" link relation</a> used with an HTTP <code>Link</code> header field, or HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.

        <h2>Arbitrary data</h2>
        <p class="pending">
          We have so far decided not to try and define a common mechanism for arbitrary data, because it's not clear to us what the correct choice would be.  Is this a reasonable position, or is there a real need for a generic solution for provenance discovery for arbitrary, non-web-accessible data objects?
        </p>
        <p>
          If a resource is represented using a data format other than HTML or RDF, and no URI for the resource is known, provenance discovery becomes trickier to achieve.  This specification does not define a specific mechanism for such arbitrary resources, but this section discusses some of the options that might be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          For formats which have provision for including metadata within the file (e.g. JPEG images, PDF documents, etc.), use the format-specific metadata to include a <a class="internalDFN">entity-URI</a>, <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a> and/or <a class="internalDFN">service-URI</a>. Format-specific metadata provision might also be used to include <a class="internalDFN">provenance information</a> directly in the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use a generic packaging format that can combine an arbitrary data file with a separate metadata file in a known format, such as RDF.  At this time, it is not clear what format that should be, but some possible candidates are:
          <ul>
            <li>MIME multipart/related [[RFC2387]]: both email and HTTP are based on MIME or MIME-derivatives, so this has the advantage of working well with the network transfer mechanisms discussed in the motivating scenarios considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Composite object-packaging work from the digital library community, of which there are several (ORE, MPEG-21, BagIt @@refs) to name a handful.  Practical implementations of these seem to commonly be based on the ZIP file format.

      <h2>Provenance Services</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes a REST based protocol [[REST-APIs]] for provenance services with facilities for the retrieval of provenance information. The protocol specifies the semantics of HTTP operations for retrival of provenance information from a provenance service. This protocol follows the approach of the SPARQl Graph Store HTTP Protocol. 
        
        The introduction of this protocol is motivated by the following reasons:
        <ul>
        <li>the naming authority associated with the entity-uri is not the same as the server managing provenance information</li>
        <li> other services may have provenance information about the same entity</li>
        <li> the naming authority for the entity-uri is not available <li.
        <li> there is no dereferencable provenance-uri containing provenance information for a particular entity</li>
        <li> provenance services may provide additional extensibility points for allowing the control over returned provenance information.
        </ul>
        
     <section>
        <h2>HTTP GET</h2>
        <blockquote>As discussed in [RFC3986], query components are often used to carry identifying information in the form of key / value pairs where the value is another URI. -- [SPARQL Graph Store HTTP Protocol]</blockquote>
        
        This protocol leverages this convention and provides a specific interface whereby a entity-uri can be embedded within the query component of the request URI:
        <p>
        <code>
        <pre>
        GET /provenance/service?<b>provenance-element</b>=http%3A//www.example.com/entity HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        </pre>
        </code>
        The embedded entity-uri (http:www.example.com/entity) is precent-encoded and identifies the entity for which provenance information is to be returned. Any server that implements this protocol and receives a request URI in this form SHOULD return provenance information for the URI embedded in the query component where the URI is the result of percent-decoding the value associated with the provenance-element key. The embedded URI MUST be an absolute URI and the server MUST respond with a 400 Bad Request if it is not.
        <p>
        If the provenance information identified in the request does not exist in the server, a 404 Not Found response code SHOULD be provided in the response. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Provenance information about a resource or resources may be returned in any format. It is recommended that the format be one defined by the Provenance Model specification [[PROV-DM]] and its associated serializations. Services must identity the <code>Content-Type</code> of the information returned. Furthermore, services SHOULD respect the <code>Content-Type</p></code> specified by the client.

      <h2>Best Practice: Using SPARQL for Provenance Queries</h2>
      <p>
        Simply identifying and retrieving provenance information as a web resource may not always meet the requirements of a particular application or service, e.g.:
        <ul>
          <li>the entity for which provenance information is required is not identified by a known URI</li>
          <li>the provenance information for an entity is not directly identified by a known URI</li>
          <li>a requirement to access provenance information for a number of distinct but related entities in a single atomic operation</li>
          <li><i>etc.</i></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        A provenance query service provides an alternative way to access provenance information and/or Provenance-URIs.  An application will need a provenance query service URI, and some relevant information about the entity whose provenance is to be accessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details of a provenance query service is an implementation choice, but for interoperability between different providers and users we recommend use of SPARQL [[RDF-SPARQL-PROTOCOL]] [[RDF-SPARQL-QUERY]].  The query service URI would then be the URI of a SPARQL endpoint  (or, to use the SPARQL specification language, a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/#conformant-sparql-protocol-service">SPARQL protocol service</a>).  The following subsections provide examples for what are considered to be some plausible common scenarios for using SPARQL, and are not intended to cover all possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>

The nature of identifying information that can be used in this way will depend upon the third party service used, further definition of which is out of scope for this specification.

        <h2>Obtain provenance information directly given an entity-URI of a resource</h2>
        <p>
          This scenario retrieves provenance information directly given the URI of a resource or entity, and may be useful where the provenance information has not been assigned a specific URI, or when the calling application is interested only in specific elements of provenance information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the original resource has an entity-URI <code>http://example.org/resource</code>, a SPARQL query for provenance information might look like this:

  @prefix prov: &lt;@@TBD&gt;

  }
  WHERE
  {
    &lt;http://example.org/resource&gt; ?p ?v
  }
          </pre>
          This query essentially extracts all available properties and values available from the query service used that are directly about the specified entity, and returns them as an RDF graph.  This may be fine if the service contains <em>only</em> provenance information about the indicated resource, or if the non-provenance information is also of interest.  A more complex query using specific provenance vocabulary terms may be needed to selectively retrieve just provenance information when other kinds of information are also available.

      <h2>Best Practice: Incremental Provenance Retrieval</h2>
      <p><a class="internalDFN">Provenance information</a> may be large. While this specification does not define how to implement scalable provenance systems, it does allow for publishers to make available provenance in an incremental fashion. We now discuss two possibilities for incremental provenance retrieval.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Via Web Retrieval</h2>
        <p>Publishers are not required to publish all the provenance information associated with a given entity at a particular <a class="internalDFN">provenance-URI</a>. The amount of provenance information exposed is application dependent. However, it is possible to incrementally retrieve (i.e. walk the provenance graph) by progressively looking up provenance information using HTTP. The pattern is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>For a given entity (<code>entity-uri-1</code>) retrieve it's associated <code>provenance-uri-1</code> and its associated <code>entity-uri-1</code> using the HTTP <code>Link</code> header (<a href="#resource-accessed-by-http" class="sectionRef"></a>)</li>
            <li>Dereference <code>provenance-uri-1</code></li>
            <li>Navigate the provenance information</li>
            <li>When reaching a dead-end during navigation, that is on encountering a reference to an entity (<code>entity-uri-2</code>) with no provided provenance information, find its provenance-URI and continue from Step 2.  (Note: an HTTP HEAD request for <code>entity-uri-2</code> may be used to obtain the Link headers without retrieving the entity content.)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>To reduce the overhead of multiple HTTP requests, a provenance information publisher are encouraged to link entities to their associated provenance information using the <code>prov:hasProvenance</code> predicate. Thus, the same pattern above applies, except instead of having to retrieve a new <code>Link</code> header field, one can immediately dereference the entity's associated provenance. 
        </p>
        <p>The same approach can be adopted when using the <a class="internalDFN">provenance service</a> API (<a href="#provenance-services" class="sectionRef"></a>). However, instead of performing an HTTP HEAD or GET against a resource one queries the provenance service using the given <a class="internalDFN">entity-uri</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Via SPARQL Queries</h2>
        <p>Provenance information may be made available using a SPARQL endpoint (<a href="#querying-provenance-information" class="sectionRef"></a>) [[RDF-SPARQL-PROTOCOL]] [[RDF-SPARQL-QUERY]]. Using SPARQL queries, provenance can be selectively retrieved using combinations of filters and or path queries.

      <h2>Security considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Provenance is central to establishing trust in data. If provenance information is corrupted, it may lead agents (human or software) to draw inappropriate and possibly harmful conclusions.  Therefore, care is needed to ensure that the integrity of provenance information is maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using HTTP to access provenance information, or to determine a provenance URI, secure HTTP (https) SHOULD be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        When retrieving a provenance URI from a document, steps SHOULD be taken to ensure the document itself is an accurate copy of the original whose author is being trusted (e.g. signature checking, or verifying its checksum against an author-provided secure web service).
      </p>
      <p class="TODO">
        @@TODO ... privacy, access control to provenance (note to self: discussed in Edinburgh linked data provenance workshop).  In particular, note that the fact that a resource is openly accessible does not mean that its provenance information should also be.

      <h2>Motivating scenario</h2>
      <p class="pending">
        I propose to replace this appendix with text based on Yogesh's walk-through of the scenario, renaming to be something like "Motivating scenario and examples"
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/ProvenanceAccessScenario">This scenario</a> was selected by the provenance working group as a touchstone for evaluating any provenance access proposal.  This appendix evaluates the foregoing proposals against the requirements implied by that scenario.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Obtaining the document D: for the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that the access to the document is either from a known Web URI, or the document is available as HTML or RDF (the primary web standards for documents and data).  The mechanisms here are in principle applicable to other document forms of a per-format basis.
            <ul>
              <li>D1, D2: use the HTTP <code>Link:</code> header.  Any server providing the document may provide this information. Different servers might offer links to different provenance sources.</li>
              <li>D3: information provided as an image with a known URI, but from a non-provenance-aware source.  The image URI can be used as a key to access a third party provenance discovery service.
              <li>D4, D6, D7, D8: information provided as an image, without a known web location.  At the very least, some mechanism, not specified here, is needed to identify the image provided.  In the case of an email attachment, it is possible (but not guaranteed) that the email message MIME wrapper specifies a URI for the image, which can be used as a key.  Some image formats support embedded metadata which might be used for this purpose.  <em>(Arbitrary data files could be wrapped in a package, say MIME multipart/related [[RFC2387]], that could include additional metadata.  Image files could be wrapped in a minimal HTML document.  It is not clear to me at this stage that a single mechanism is appropriate for all situations)</em>.</li>
              <li>D5: HTML email.  Depending on how the HTML is constructed, the HTML header could include <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Lacking identification or in-band metadata, some independent identification of the thing represented by an available mechanism is required.  <em>I think this is unavoidable</em></li>
          <li>Enacting the "Oh yeah?" feature
            <ul>
              <li>W: once a URI for provenance information has been determined, accessing it using a web browser or other web client software should be straightforward.  If the provenance is accessible via a third party query service, that may be less straightforward.</li>
              <li>E: this scenario seems to envisage a wholesale overhaul of email client software, which seems unlikely.  If a URI for provenance can be provided, the natural way to access it would be via a web client of some kind, which might be a browser or other software.</li>
              <li>S: this scenario effectively calls for this:  given an arbitrary data resource, implement a general purpose application to discover, retrieve and analyze provenance about that resource.  At the present time, this is a matter for experimental development, which could be based substantially on the mechanisms described for provenance discovery and access via third party services.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I: Accessing the provenance
            <ul>
              <li>W: a web client needs one or more URIs for provenance information, and/or URI(s) for a provenance query service and sufficient additional information about the resource to formulate an effective query.  They may also need access information that can be used to assess (or help a user assess) the trustworthiness of provenance of information obtained, (which could be more provenance information)</li>
              <li>E: an email client is a passive receiver of information, so asking one to retrieve provenance information is a perverse expectation.  There have been some attempts to standardize email protocols that interact with the email sender but such mechanisms have not been significantly deployed in practice. This case can be viewed as a variation on the shell-client case (S) below.  If all provenance information is sent <em>with</em> the original content using standard email mechanisms (MIME multipart, etc.) then the email client may use that (or hand it off to a helper application) as the basis for provenance-based analysis or presentation.</li>
              <li>S: command shell or other local application.  This is the general case for provenance access.  Given some arbitrary information, what does a provenance-aware application need to access the required provenance information?  It may employ any of the mechanisms described above.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Gap analysis</h2>
        <p>
          There are clearly a number of capabilities needed for a provenance-aware application that are not covered by the mechanisms described above.  But most of these amount to implementation details and decisions for a particular application, and as such are beyond the scope of this document to specify.
        </p>
        <p>
          One feature not covered above that might be a candidate for specification is a common format for a data package that combines original content along with provenance-related metadata or data.  At this stage, it is not clear what format that might take, but some possible candidates are discussed in <a href="#arbitrary-data" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          In any case, it seems to me that a specification that is specific for provenance to the exclusion of other metadata is unlikely to obtain traction, as provenance is just part of a wider landscape of information quality, trust, preservation and more.
