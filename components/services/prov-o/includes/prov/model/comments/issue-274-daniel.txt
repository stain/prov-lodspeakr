Removed

No name had been agreed.  
Waiting to see how discussion on account progresses.

No consensus was reached. Document mentions both
 People and Human

We reverted back to the previous definiitions.

It is an overview, intentionally, simplifying the presentation,
including not showing some edges.
With the component-based presentation, further small diagrams will be produced.

TODO: add a sentence saying that it is not complete coverage of the dm in diagram.

Figures to be drawn by hand.  Note added.

Same.

Nothing to do.

This is ISSUE-94, which is now closed.

This is proposed to be reorganized for WD5.

Text of notes has not been updated. 
Hopefully, this note can be removed soon.

Yes, proposal to come for WD5.

Updated definition to allow for non-geographic places.

Added to the notes, these sections need rewriting.

In WD5, they will constitute one of the components.

To represent something that happens, then one needs to use an activity, to
which one can attach duration.

This could go in a best practice document, but ... nobody is taking charge
of such a document. Would you volunteer? ;-)
