This heading is also in prov-aq.

We received very clear feedback, from Ivan in particular, that we need
to be clear about the order in which readers should approach our
documents.

It is the Chairs' intent to have a PROV-overview document. In the
meantime, this kind of information is placed in the SOTD paragram.

Merged section 1.2 and 1.3 in a single section "notational conventions"

This section lists prefixes and namespace uris used in this document.
The purpose of the PROV namespace is discussed in 4.7.1

We discuss namespace in 4.7.1.   This discussion of forming URIs by concatenating
namespace URI and  local name is already part of 4.7.2.

I removed this sentence. The example already mentions document at URI.

The recent changes in PROV-AQ also indicate that web resource can also
be activity or anything identifiable in the model.

Adopt Simon's definition here.

An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing; entities may be real or imaginary.

Updated as follows: 

An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, generating, or being associated with entities.

All are types of entities, from this point of view it's logical.
We can instead take the 'component 2 approach' in which we
merge agent, plan, attribution, association, responsibility.

prov:Collection is similar to RDF container
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty

Except that "keys" are not restricted to be rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ... but
allowed to be prov-dm values.


prov:Collection can also describe car (rdf:first), cdr (rdf:rest) for list.

This kind of usage should into the "collection primer", to be written.

So, given this, we don't think that we are imposing a particular view
on collections that may not be appropriate.

It was agreed a long time ago that the identifier identifies the entity as opposed to the record. So, we don't see what is redundant or confusing here.

Could you raise an issue and/or clarify your comment?
