The term "upgrade path" was replaced by "refinement".

The last section reuses the term. As the introduction states it, this
is discussed in part 2.

More work to be done on this, to decide how we handle accounts.
There is no reference to resource in the definition.

This sentence is now removed from section 4.6.1. 
A sentence to that effect already exists in 4.6.2.

Definition of Original Source has been revised. It should avoid the ambiguity.

The latter sentence is a refinement of the previous one for digital entities.
I think this is OK.

Text updated.

We decided at F2F2 that the notion of event should not be discussed in the prov-dm document (part 1). 
It is left to part 2 (semantics/constraints).
