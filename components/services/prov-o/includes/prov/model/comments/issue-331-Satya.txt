This has already been discussed

It changes the situation of the work of art:
from
  location="London"
to
  location="NY"

This has been discussed many times.

Provenance descriptions are not identifiable ... so difficult to make them entities.
The mechanism to identify description is to bundle them up in a named account.

Text was updated.

In both cases, we are dealing with a document.  It's the same resource,
but we describe it differently.  In the first case, it is edited by edit1,
in the second, it is published by act2.


Section4:
1. The statement "The fourth component consists of relations linking entities somehow referring to a same thing." is ambiguous - suggestion is to remove "somehow"

OK

It may not be specified, but it is existentially implied. This aspect
is covered in prov-dm-constraints.

The term trigger is defined there. It's an entity.

The definition of trigger does not mention responsibility.
Agent implies responsibility.

But you would have to add wasAssociatedWith/wasAttributedTo link entity/activity to agent.

It's existentially implied. See part II.

I am not sure what the question?

wasRevisionOf(tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215, tr:WD-prov-dm-20111018, -)
implies
wasDerivedFrom(tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215, tr:WD-prov-dm-20111018)

but not the converse. it's a sub-relation.

hadOriginalSource(dm:term-original-source,go:credit-where-credit-is-due.html)
implies
wasDerivedFrom(dm:term-original-source,go:credit-where-credit-is-due.html)
which implies
tracedTo(dm:term-original-source,go:credit-where-credit-is-due.html)

TODO: to check what traceability becomes with new defintion of agent!!!

It's not explicit, it's up to the asserter

???? 
 redirect? it's a resource!

Ability to sustitute is not the intent of alternate.

No, we leave the encoding of locations open, but they must be values.
