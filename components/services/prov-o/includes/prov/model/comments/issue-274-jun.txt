Terminology does not appear in the paper any more, as agreed by WG.

Components will be put in place in WD5.

Note added to file.

TODO: we need to say it's a conceptual model

Now we have descriptions of the examples up front.
The example is not intended to cover all concepts.
Hence, other smaller examples appear in the various sections.

Core/common will be replaced by components in WD5.
See above regarding scruffy.

We need a pass of link editing, as part of WD5.
