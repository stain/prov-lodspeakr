We received suggestions
- to move prov-n section earlier (james)
- to move it later (gk)
- that the structure is right.

It feels that it's about right! 

Examples can optionally be hidden. There is now just one page of concept
definitions, before getting to the class diagram.

The point was to have a *real* example with real urls.
Furthermore, nothing in the provenance descriptions is really specific
to the prov-wg, in the sense that all Recs go through the same kind
of transition.

As a WG, I would hope we can come up with more than one examples.

I am worried about the reference to section 4.3 which refers to an old version of the document
WD4? pre-component?

I think it's more important to explain the various concepts first, before
some of the building blocks, e.g. namespace, identifiers, attributes.

Added forwarding links for prov:type in entity/activity examples.

Updated section 2.6 clarifying some of these issues.

We had voted definitions for generation/usage. I am just reusing them.

Which ones? Can you list them? Alternative suggestions are welcome!

Same commennt as Curt.  I think it's important to talk about people
here. Our agents only mean "bearer of responsibility".

Fixed it twice.

Updated section 2.6.

In section 4, for the first occurrences of prov:type and prov:role, I have
added link to their respective sections.

Done

Updated bullet 3 in section 2.6.

Yes.

Replaced everywhere according to GK's suggestion

The assertions of entity and note occur at moments.

Does this make sense for prov:location?
