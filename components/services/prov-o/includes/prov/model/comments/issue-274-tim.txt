Updated to:
 However, if data changes, it is challenging to express its provenance precisely, like it would be for any other form of metadata.

Section 4 provides the definition of PROV-DM constructs.

This is just an example for agent, we shouldn't illustrate responsibility here. This comes laters.

This will revisited as part of the overall discussion on accounts. 
So, for now, no action.

Other option is to drop this subtype of entity. We don't need to express provenance of provenance.

OK, dropped.

I prefer Activity wasStartedBy Agent and think that some other involvement should be named for the special informed involvement Activity ?triggered? Activity.

It's general property of definitions, they don't refer to the past explicitly. We think it's fine.

This is not a grammar, so it's not appropriate to use square brackets mark the optional nature.
The square brackets used for [ attr1=val1, ...] are part of the syntax!

When using AccountEntity, the annotated thing can be described _directly_ as a single triple instead of using Notes. Notes are very much "scruffy  provenance" and do not benefit from the directness afforded by AccountEntity / prov:Provenance.

See email discussion. I don't think we have reached agreement yet.

We feel that even if the activity is not specified, there is an implied activity, so this is reasonable to keep
the name wasGeneratedBy. Thoughts?

It's to address ISSUE-XXX that we have introducing this statement. We don't feel it's a distraction.

We don't see this distracting, it's an example, a real-use case in workflow. 
What is it that is being discouraged by this example?

What about  deputy and superior?
