OK, no longer talk about "thing in the world" but "thing".

We now call it PROV-N.

Having gone through the process of writing productions fully, there
are some grammatical syntactic details that have no place in the PROV-DM document.
Also, PROV-N  provides examples of instances to explain the grammar.
This has no place in the PROV-DM document either.

Furthermore, past experience has shown that readers confuse prov-dm and prov-n.

So, the editor's recommendation is to keep the documents separate.

Rephrased as follows:

An activity is something that occurs and acts upon or with entities.

It was agreed at F2F2 that we shouldn't introduce event in part 1.
We followed this guidance.  The term event is only defined in part 2.

Updated definitions as follows:

Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity.

Usage is the beginning of consumption of a new entity by an activity.

To be addressed, once other editing work for WD5 is completed.

The two notions (container vs bundle) are useful, for different purposes.
To be investigated.

This is made clearer, following definition and in example.

Subtle difference again: "... treated as an entity ..." vs " ... is an entity ..."

We can definitely add "... which may itself have some associated provenance "

The example about software agent was simplified. Indeed no need to mention responsibility here.
This is left to section 2.4.

It's a ternary relation.
This was discussed at length in ISSUE-203, which is now closed.

I am not proposing to reopen it, unless new information is brought forward.

We are now generating a PNG, so hopefully its better.

After careful consideration, we felt it was better to leave it in section 2.5, in part,
because we need to map the concepts (expressed in natural language) to prov-dm types/relations.

Usual trade-off. Now that concepts seem clearer, than we don't need examples.

I think that examples are clearly delimited and can be skipped if the reader wants.

Publishing of documents and their provenance on the Web. 
It seems that it is a primary use case for this specification.

We received positive feedback about the example, and in particular that
it deals with attribution of provenance.

Gone with the new component structure.

Section 4 contains the systematic presentation of all types and relations.
Given that many had not been (and should not be) introduced in the
"starting point section", it is better to have *all* terms defined in section 4.

This seems in conflict with the next comment.  Or is it just about the
English (avoiding disjoint term)?

why not?  In particular, this was introduced in response to feedback
from the working group.

OK

This is ISSUE-260, potentially related to account. We will tackle
this once we have some bandwidth.

To me, it's crucial to be able to annotate provenance, and to do so in
an inter-operable way, whatever the serialization.

The questioni is whether the mechanism presented here is the right
one, or, as Tim suggests, Accounts take care of that.

Table was kept as a form of index.
Structure changed to components.

All done.

Some are repeat, some are new, as indicated above.

The template shows instances of arguments, where as the descriptions
provide names for attributes.

PROV-DM allows you to express the relations.
If I understood correctly, we have:

wasGeneratedBy(component,purchase)
actedOnBehalfOf(engineer,manager,purchase, [role="line management"])
actedOnBehalfOf(manager,engineer,deployment, [role="technical guidance"])

PROV-DM does not say how to reason about responsibility.
What is the answer to your question?

This said, did you mean
 actedOnBehalfOf(manager,engineer,deployment, [role="technical guidance"])
or  did you mean:
 wasInformedBy(manager,engineer)

Do you mean in PROV-DM?

Yes, I think these are relations of the data model. They need
to be introduced in this document.
