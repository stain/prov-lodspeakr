Done.

Yes, good added.

Introduction of Section 5.1 was changed.

e0 is not a type, e0 describe the file.
Nothing done here, but we may want to revisit the example.

recipe link was removed, but I added some type attribute with the suggested types.

I have edited the text.

I have made sure production is defined earlier (+ link added).

Intro of 5.1 was changed. We are just listing here the kind of records that this section defines.

I have added in overview section.  

  In addition to the kinds of record introduced in the overview
  figure, PROV-DM also features a notion of <a title="account
  record">Account Record</a> that allows attribution of provenance
  records to be expressed.

There is here some brief motivation for the provenance container.

Axioms have not been defined in this document.
So, I suggest the following instead:

 ... then they are required to CREATE multiple entity records (EITHER BY DIRECT ASSERTION OR BY INFERENCE)

Woudl be nice to do it in section 4 too.
TODO.

Yes, updated.

I take the point, but Delegation is not better, and seems too specific.
I think, more generally, we need to revisit exactly how we pitch responsibility.
See thread ISSUE-203.

OK, done.

TODO, as we gather more feedback on responsibility.

Text has been updated. Attribute steps was introduced first.

All being rewritten.

Added an intro to 5.4.1

Nesting still needs to be debated.

Added:  if the two activities <span class="name">a0</span> and <span class="name">a1</span> are distinct.

This whole section is to be structured in any case.

Added an introduction to 6.2.

I replaced the word control. I didnt see why remove the responsibility bit?

Yes, kept for later ;-)
