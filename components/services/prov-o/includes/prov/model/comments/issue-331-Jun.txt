Added glossary definitions to section 4.2.1.

Note: I removed the three types of agents from section 2.3.

You are right, not all concepts.
Only the *relations* have a past tense form.

It's true that tense was not consistently used.
Fixed, hopefully, now, all in past tense.

This is a prov-o question.

Done. Removed all of these, and adopted GK suggested phrasing.

We need to remove this reference to time.

---> "which members it contains as it evolves"

Effect first, cause second. 
That's the order that is followed consistently in the document.

TODO: should we consider renaming memberOf to fit subject first, object second?

contains -> "has the following pairs has members".

Also fixed the font issue.

Good point. Don't know how to address it. We can also drop this paragraph
from the main DM and leave this to part 2. It would consistent with the rest.

TODO: mutability of collections

I added definition for note:

A note is an identified set of application-specific attribute-value pairs.

The attribute prov:label provides a human-readable representation of a PROV-DM element or relation. The value associated with the attribute prov:label must be a string.

Isn't the difference clear?
