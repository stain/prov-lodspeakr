Do we use sparql to *retrieve* provenance? To query it, yes.

it's still the fourth *public* WD.

Is this implied by consumption? Then, yes, it was not the intent.

Replaced consumption by utilization

Done: we now start with the author view.

Removed a confusing occurrence of component, and also constituent.

It's useful to have groupings of concepts, to give some structure to the dm.
The term component is reasonable for this.

'far more important' is a very relative concepts. Some may not want
to express derivation, some may not want to express responsibility.

Having thought about it a lot, it is not clear what other logical
order to follow.

Added: "It is assumed that the activities <span class="name">a1</span> and <span class="name">a2</span> are of type "workflow" and "subworkflow", respectively; the latter was started by the former."

I don't see this.

It goes against the convention we adopted in prov-dm that all
relations between entities that matter from a provenance viewpoint are
expressed by means of prov-dm relations, and not by means of
attributes.


We have added an optional attribute complete to the relation membship
to address this specific point.
