This comment needs to be re-considered later. At this stage, I would
prefer to keep these concepts there, until the model is completely
finalized. We could reassess then.

Added sentence, at the beginning of section 3.

Added descriptions in section 3.1 and 3.2.

The whole point was to use real identifiers, to be close to "scruffy
provenance".

It was difficult to reorganize, since we needed to introduce the
various concepts. So, instead, a sentence introduces the graphical
notation.

I am not sure I understand. 
Need to get Eric to point to concrete differences.

 which names in the table?

Updated location definition to allow for non-geographic places.
