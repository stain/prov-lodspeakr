Part 1 definitely remains prov-dm.

We feel that there is no 'extended prov-dm' in part 2, but simply a set of constraints.
So, we propose to keep it for now.

Yes, a short summary needs to be added.
TODO.

But, this is compatible with our definition: "Entities are things in the world one wants to provide provenance for."

Yes, but the definition of agent is independent of these terms. 
That's the key thing. Of course, relations will link agents in various ways.
We have added the following sentence:

  "Concepts such as initiating are themselves defined as relations between agent and activities."

The reason for the term 'completed' has explained, by rephrasing the first paragraph of this section.
So, we are keeping the term.

There must always be a first time for every thing ;-)
That's the point of this section to introduce them, before using them in 2.4/2.5

The diagram is probably in the right place but requires narrative to justify it.

TODO: check printed quality.

No action.

done

It has become:
  an identifier for an entity

I don't think so, we want to stay away from 'characterizing'

As a compromise, we keep the statement on disjointness in part 1, 
but move explanation to part II.

This is a prov-o issue.  Not all constraints need to be implemented in
an ontology/schema. This applies equally to xml schema.

Yes, this has now been added.

Simplification of derivation is for WD5.

Traceability is there just for the purpose of inference.
This will be reorganized as part of WD5 component structure.

I don't think so, they should stay here. The examples are simple enough.

Part II is not about new elements/relations it's about their constraints.

A component structure will be adopted in WD5.

The table and its introduction will be revisited as part of WD5.
