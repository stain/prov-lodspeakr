PROV-DM, the PROV data model, is a data model for provenance that describes
the entities, people and activities involved in
producing a piece of data or thing. 
PROV-DM is structured in six components, dealing with: 
(1) entities and activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended;
(2) agents bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened;
(3) derivations of entities from entities;
(4) properties to link entities that refer to the same thing;
(5) collections forming a logical structure for its members;
(6) a simple annotation mechanism.
</p>

<p>This document introduces the provenance concepts found in
PROV and defines PROV-DM types and
relations. PROV data model is domain-agnostic, but is equipped with
extensibility points allowing domain-specific information to be included. </p>

<p>Two further documents complete the specification of PROV-DM.
First, a companion document specifies the set of constraints that
provenance descriptions should follow.  Second, 
a separate document describes a provenance notation for expressing 
instances of provenance for human consumption; this notation is used in examples in
this document. </p>

<section id="sotd">
<h4>PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
This document is part of the PROV family of specifications, a set of specifications defining various aspects that are necessary to achieve the vision of inter-operable
interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.  The specifications are:
<ul>
<li> PROV-DM, the PROV data model for provenance (this document);</li>
<li> PROV-CONSTRAINTS, a set of constraints applying to the PROV data model;</li>
<li> PROV-N, a notation for provenance aimed at human consumption;</li>
<li> PROV-O, the PROV ontology, an OWL-RL ontology allowing the mapping of PROV to RDF;</li>
<li> PROV-AQ, the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance; </li>
<li> PROV-PRIMER, a primer for the PROV data model;</li>
<li> PROV-SEM, a formal semantics for the PROV data model;</li>
<li> PROV-XML, an XML schema for the PROV data model.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to read the PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
<ul>
<li>The primer is the entry point to PROV offering an introduction to the provenance model.</li>
<li>The Linked Data and Semantic Web community should focus on PROV-O defining PROV classes and properties specified in an OWL-RL ontology. For further details, PROV-DM and PROV-CONSTRAINTS specify the constraints applicable to the data model, and its interpretation. PROV-SEM provides a mathematical semantics.</li>
<li>The XML community should focus on PROV-XML defining an XML schema for PROV. Further details can also be found in PROV-DM, PROV-CONSTRAINTS, and PROV-SEM.</li>
<li>Developers seeking to retrieve or publish provenance should focus on PROV-AQ.</li>
<li>Readers seeking to implement other PROV serializations
should focus on PROV-DM and PROV-CONSTRAINTS.  PROV-O, PROV-N, PROV-XML offer examples of mapping to RDF, text, and XML, respectively.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Fourth Public Working Draft</h4>
<p>This is the fourth public release of the PROV-DM document. Following feedback, the Working Group has decided to reorganize this document substantially, separating the data model from its contraints and the notation used to illustrate it. The PROV-DM release is synchronized with the release of the PROV-O, PROV-PRIMER, PROV-N, and PROV-CONSTRAINTS documents. We are now clarifying the entry path to the PROV family of specifications.</p>

    <section id="introduction"> 
      <h2>Introduction<br>
</h2> 

<p> 
For the purpose of this specification, <dfn>provenance</dfn> is defined as a record that describes the people,
institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing.
In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding
whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its
originators when reusing it.  In an open and inclusive environment
such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or
questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
</p>


<p>
We
consider a core data model for provenance that allows  domain and application specific representations of provenance to be translated into such a data model and  <em>interchanged</em> between systems.
Thus, heterogeneous systems can export their native provenance into such a core data model, and applications that need to make sense of provenance in heterogeneous systems can then import it,
process it, and reason over it.</p>

<p>A set of specifications, referred to as the PROV family of specifications, define the various aspects
that are necessary to achieve this vision in an interoperable
way:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data model for provenance, which is presented in three documents:
<ul>
<li> PROV-DM (part I): the provenance data model, informally described (this document);
<li> PROV-CONSTRAINTS (part II): constraints underpinning the data model [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]];
<li> PROV-N (part III): a notation to express instances of that data model for human consumption [[PROV-N]];
</ul> 
</li>
<li>PROV-O: the PROV ontology, an OWL-RL ontology allowing the mapping of PROV to RDF [[PROV-O]];</li>
<li>PROV-AQ: the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance [[PROV-AQ]];</li>
<li>PROV-PRIMER: a primer for the PROV approach [[PROV-PRIMER]];</li>
<li>PROV-SEM: semantics of the PROV-DM data model [[PROV-SEM]];</li>
<li>PROV-XML: an XML schema for the PROV data model.</li>
</ul>


<p>
The  PROV data model is a domain-agnostic model, but with clear extensibility points allowing further domain-specific and
application-specific extensions to be defined.
The PROV data model is structured according to six components covering various aspects of provenance:</p>
<ul>
<li> component 1: entities and activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended;
<li> component 2: agents bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened;
<li> component 3: derivations of entities from others;
<li> component 4: properties to link entities that refer to a same thing;
<li> component 5: collections forming a logical structure for its members;
<li> component 6: a simple annotation mechanism.
</ul>


<p>This specification presents the key concepts of the PROV Data Model, and
provenance types and relations, without specific concern for how they are applied.
With these, it becomes possible to write useful provenance descriptions, and publish or embed them along side the data they relate to. </p>

<p>However, if something about which provenance is expressed is subject to change, then it is challenging to express its provenance precisely (e.g. the data from which a daily weather report is derived  changes from day to day).
 To address this challenge, a <em>refinement</em> is proposed to enrich simple provenance, with extra descriptions that  help qualify the specific subject of provenance and provenance itself, with attributes and temporal information, intended to satisfy a comprehensive set of constraints.  These aspects are covered in the companion specification [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]].

<section id='starting-points'> 
<h1>PROV Starting Points</h1>

<p>
This section introduces provenance concepts with informal descriptions and illustrative
examples.  Since PROV-DM is a conceptual data
model, Section 2.5 maps the concepts to various types and relations,
which are illustrated graphically in
a simplified UML diagram in <a href="#prov-dm-overview">Figure 1</a>.  Section 2.6
then summarizes the PROV notation allowing instances of PROV-DM to be
written down.

<h2>Entity and Activity</h2>


<p>Things we want to describe  the provenance of are called <em>entities</em> in PROV. The term "things" encompasses a broad diversity of notions, including digital objects such as a file or web page, 
physical things such as a building or a printed book, or a car as well as abstract concepts and ideas. </p>

<p>
<div class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-entity"  data-withspan="true">
</div>



<div class="conceptexample" id="entity-example">
<p>An entity may be the document at URI <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17526723">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17526723</a>, a file in a file system, a car, or an idea.</p>
</div>



<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-activity"  data-withspan="true"></span> Activities that operate on digital entities may for example move, copy, or duplicate them.
</p>



<div class="conceptexample" id="activity-example">
<p>An activity may be the publishing of a document on the Web, sending a twitter message, extracting metadata embedded in a file, driving a car from Boston to Cambridge, assembling a data set based on a set of measurements, performing a statistical analysis over a data set, sorting news items according to some criteria, running a SPARQL query over a triple store, or editing a file.</p>

    <section id="section-generation-usage-derivation"> 
<h2>Generation, Usage, Derivation</h2>

<p>Activities and entities are associated with each other in two different ways: activities utilize entities and activities  produce entities. The act of utilizing or producing an entity may have a duration.  
 The term 'generation' refers to the completion of the act of producing; likewise, the term 'usage' refers to the beginning of the act of utilizing entities. Thus, we define the following notions of generation and usage. </p>

<div class="conceptexample" id="generation-example">
<p>Examples of generation are the completed creation of a file by a
program, the completed creation of a linked data set, and the completed
publication of a new version of a document.

<p>Usage examples include a procedure beginning to consume an argument, a service starting to read a value on a port, a program beginning to read a configuration
file, or the point at which an ingredient, such as eggs, is being added in a baking activity. Usage may entirely consume an entity (e.g. eggs are no longer available after being added to
the mix); in contrast, the same entity may be used multiple times, possibly by different activities (e.g. a file on a file system can be read indefinitely).

<p>Activities utilize entities and producer entities. In some cases, utilizing an entity influences the creation of another in some way. This notion is captured by derivations, defined as follows.</p>

<h2>Agents, Attribution, Association, and Responsibility</h2>

<p>The motivation for introducing  agents in the model is to express the agent's responsibility for activities that happened and entities that were generated. </p>

<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-agent"  data-withspan="true">
</span> An agent MAY be a particular type of entity. This means that the model can be
 used to express provenance of the agents themselves.  
</p>


<!--
<p>
The definition of agent intentionally stays away from using concepts such as enabling, causing, initiating, triggering, affecting, etc, because many entities also enable, cause, initiate, and affect in some way
the activities. (Concepts such as triggers are themselves defined later in relations between entities and activities.)   So the notion of having some degree of responsibility is really what makes an agent.</p>
-->



<div class="conceptexample" id="agent-example">
<p>
Software for checking the use of grammar in a document may be defined as an agent of a document preparation activity, and at the same time one can describe its provenance, including for instance the vendor and the version history. 
A site selling books on the Web, the services involved in the processing of orders, and the companies hosting them are also agents.
</p>
</div>


<p>Agents may adopt sets of actions or steps to achieve their goals. This is captured by the notion of plan. </p>

<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-plan"  data-withspan="true">
</span>
There exist no
prescriptive requirement on the nature of plans, their representation, the
actions or steps they consist of, or their intended goals.  Since plans may evolve over time,
it may become necessary to track their provenance, so plans themselves are
entities. Representing the plan explicitly in the provenance can be useful for various tasks: for example, to  
validate the execution as represented in the provenance record, to  
manage expectation failures, or to provide explanations.</p> 

<div class="conceptexample" id="plan-example">
<p>
A plan can be a blog post tutorial for how to set up a web server, a list of instructions for a micro-processor execution, a cook's written recipe for a chocolate cake, or a workflow for a scientific experiment.

<p>
Agents are defined as having some kind of responsibility for activities. In some  
cases, those activities reflect the execution of a plan that was  
designed in advance to guide the execution.  Thus,
a plan may also be linked to an activity.  </p>

<p>So far, we have introduced a series of concepts underpinning provenance.   PROV-DM  is a conceptual data model consisting of types and relations between these.  <a href="#overview-types-and-relations">Table 2</a> shows how provenance concepts can be mapped to types and relations in PROV-DM: the first column lists concepts introduced in this section, the second column indicates whether a concept maps to a type or a relation, whereas the third column contains the corresponding name.    Names of relations have a verbal form in the past tense to express what happened in the past, as opposed to what may or will happen.

<h2>PROV-N: The Provenance Notation</h2>


<p>To illustrate the application of PROV concepts to a concrete example (see <a href="#prov-dm-example">Section 3</a>) and to provide examples of concepts (see <a href="#data-model-components">Section 4</a>),
we introduce PROV-N, a notation for writing instances of the PROV data model. For full details, the reader is referred to the companion specification [[PROV-N]].
PROV-N is a notation  aimed at human consumption, with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>PROV-N expressions adopt a <em>functional notation</em> consisting
of a name and a list of arguments in parentheses.</li>

<li>The interpretation of PROV-N arguments is defined according to their <em>position</em> in the list of arguments. This convention allows for a compact notation. </li>

<li>
PROV-N <em>optional arguments</em> need not be specified:
the general rule for optional arguments is that, if none of them are used in the expression, then they are simply omitted, resulting in a simpler expression. However, it may be the case that only some of the optional arguments need to be specified. Because the position of the arguments in the expression matters, in this case an additional marker must be used to indicate that a particular term is not available. The syntactic marker  <span class="name">-</span> is used for this purpose.
</li>

<li>Most expressions 
include an identifier 
and a set of attribute-value pairs; both are optional unless otherwise specified. By convention, the identifier occurs in the <em>first position</em>, and the the set of attribute-value pairs in the <em>last position</em>.
Consistent with the convention on arguments, the marker  <span class="name">-</span> can be used when the identifier is not available, or can be omitted altogether with no ambiguity arising.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="anexample">
<p>
An activity with identifier <span class="name">a1</span> and an attribute <span class="name">type</span> with value <span class="name">createFile</span>.
<pre class="codeexample" >
activity(a1, [prov:type="createFile"])
</pre>
Two entities with identifiers <span class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>.
<pre class="codeexample" >
entity(e1)
entity(e2)
</pre>
The activity  <span class="name">a1</span> used  <span class="name">e1</span>, and <span class="name">e2</span> was generated by <span class="name">a1</span>.
<pre class="codeexample" >
used(a1,e1)
wasGeneratedBy(e2,a1)
</pre>
The same description, but with an explicit identifier <span class="name">u1</span> for the usage, and the syntactic marker <span class="name">-</span> to mark the absence of identifier in the generation.

<h2>Illustration of PROV-DM by an Example</h2>

<p><a href="#starting-points">Section 2</a> has introduced some provenance concepts, and how they are expressed as types or relations in the PROV data model. The purpose of this section is to put these concepts into practice in order to express the provenance of some document published on the Web.  
With this realistic example, PROV concepts are  composed together,  and a graphical illustration shows a provenance description forming a directed graph, rooted at the entity we want to explain the provenance of, and pointing to the entities, activities, and agents it depended on. This example also shows that, sometimes, multiple provenance descriptions about the same entity can co-exist, which then justifies the need for provenance of provenance.</p>


<p>In this example, we consider one of the many documents published by the World Wide Web Consortium, and describe its provenance. 
Specifically, we consider the document identified by
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215</a>. Its provenance can be expressed from several perspectives: first,  provenance can take the authors' viewpoint; second, it can be concerned with the W3C process. Then, attribution of these two provenance descriptions is provided.</p>


<section id="section-example-one"> 
<h3>The Authors View</h3>


<p style="font-style:italic; " ><b>Description:</b> A document
is edited by some editor, using contributions from various
contributors.

<p>In this perspective, provenance of the document

<p>We paraphrase some PROV-DM descriptions, express them with the PROV-N notation, and then depict them with a graphical illustration (see <a href="#prov-a-document1">Figure 1</a>).
Full details of the provenance record can be found <a href="examples/w3c-publication3.pn">here</a>.</p>

<p>
Provenance descriptions can be <em>illustrated</em> graphically. The illustration is not intended to represent all the details of the model, but it is intended to show the essence of a set of
provenance descriptions.  Therefore, it should not be seen as an alternate notation for expressing provenance.</p>

<p>The graphical illustration takes the form of a graph. Entities, activities and agents are represented as nodes, with oval, rectangular, and pentagonal shapes, respectively.  Usage,
Generation, Derivation, and Association are represented as directed edges.</p>

<p>Entities are laid out according to the ordering of their generation.  We endeavor to show time progressing from left to right. This means that edges for Usage, Generation,
Derivation, Association typically point leftwards</p>

<h3>The Process View</h3>


<p style="font-style:italic; " ><b>Description:</b> The World Wide Web
Consortium publishes documents according to its publication
policy.  Working drafts are published regularly to reflect the work
accomplished by working groups. Every publication of a working draft
must be preceded by a "publication request" to the Webmaster.  The
very first version of a document must also be preceded by a
"transition request" to be approved by the W3C director.  All working
drafts are made available at a unique URI.  In this scenario, we consider two successive versions of a given document, the policy according to which they were published, and the associated requests.
</p>

We describe the kind of provenance record that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium">WWW Consortium</a> could keep for auditors to check that due processes are followed.

<p> This simple example has shown a variety of PROV concepts, such as Entity, Agent, Activity, Usage, Generation, Derivation, and Association. In this example, it happens that all entities were already Web resources, with readily available URIs, which we used. We note that some of the resources are public, whereas others have restricted access: provenance statements only make use of their identifiers. If identifiers do not pre-exist, e.g. for activities, then they can be generated, for instance <span class="name">ex:act2</span>, occurring in the namespace identified by prefix <span class="name">ex</span>.  We note that the URI scheme developed by W3C is particularly suited for expressing provenance of these documents, since each URI denotes a specific version of a document. It then becomes easy to relate the various versions with  PROV-DM relations. We note that an Association is a ternary relation (represented by a multi-edge labeled wasAssociatedWith) from an activity to an agent and a plan.</p>


</section>


<section id="section-example-c"> 
<h3>Attribution of Provenance</h3>

<p>The two previous sections  provide  two different perspectives on the provenance of a document By design, the PROV approach allows for the provenance of a subject to be provided by multiple sources. For users to decide whether they can place their trust in the document, they may want to analyze its provenance, but also determine
who the provenance is attributed to, and when it was
generated, etc. In other words, we need to be able to express the provenance of provenance.</p>

<p>No new mechanism is required to support this requirement.  PROV-DM makes the assumption that provenance statements have been bundled up, and named, by some mechanism outside the scope of PROV-DM. For instance, in this case, provenance statements were put in a file and exposed on the Web, respectively at <a href="examples/w3c-publication1.pn">ex:w3c-publication1.pn</a> and <a href="examples/w3c-publication3.pn">ex:w3c-publication3.pn</a>.   To express their respective provenance, these resources must be seen as entities, and all the constructs of PROV-DM are now available to characterize their provenance. In the example below, <span class="name">ex:w3c-publication1.pn</span> is attributed to the agent <span class="name">w3:Consortium</span>, whereas <span class="name">ex:w3c-publication3.pn</span> to <span class="name">ex:Simon</span>.

While  not all PROV-DM relations are binary, they all involve two primary elements. Hence, <a href="#relations-at-a-glance">Table 3</a> indexes all relations according to their two primary elements.  The table adopts the same color scheme as <a href="#prov-dm-components">Figure 4</a>, allowing components to be readily identified.
Note that for simplicity, this table  does not include collection-oriented relations.

<h3>Component 1: Entities and Activities</h3>

<p>The first component of PROV-DM is concerned with <a title="entity">entities</a> and <a title="activity">activities</a>, and their interrelations: <a>Usage</a>, <a>Generation</a>, <a>Start</a>, <a>End</a>, <a>Invalidation</a>, <a>Communication</a>, and <a>Start by Activity</a>.  <a href="#figure-component1">Figure 5</a> uses UML to depict the first component, with two classes and binary associations between them. Associations are not just binary: indeed, <a>Usage</a>, <a>Generation</a>, <a>Start</a>, <a>End</a> also include <em>time</em> attributes.

In some cases, we may want to record the time at which an entity was generated without having to specify the activity that generated it. To support this requirement, the activity element in generation is optional.

<h4>Invalidation</h4>


<div class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-invalidation"></div>



<p>
Entities have a duration. Generation marks the beginning of an entity. An entity's lifetime can end for different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li> an entity was destroyed: e.g. a painting was destroyed by fire; a Web page is taken out of a site;
<li> an entity was consumed: e.g. Bob ate all his soup, Alice ran out of gas when driving to work;
<li> an entity expires: e.g. a "buy one beer, get one free" offer is valid during happy hour (7-8pm);
<li> an entity is time limited: e.g. the BBC news site on April 3rd, 2012;
<li> an entity attribute is changing: e.g. the traffic light changed from green to red.
</ul>
<p>In the first two cases, the entity has physically disappeared after its termination: there is no more soup, or painting.  In the last two cases, there may be an "offer voucher" that still exists, but it is no longer valid; likewise, on April 4th, the BBC news site still exists but it is not the same entity as BBC news Web site on April 3rd; or the traffic light became red and therefore is regarded as a different entity to the green light.

<h4>Responsibility</h4>

<div class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-responsibility"></div>

<p>PROV offers a mild version of responsibility
in the form of a relation to represent when an agent acted on another
agent's behalf.  So for example someone running a mail program,
the program and the person are both
agents of the activity; furthermore, the mail software
agent is running on the person's behalf.  In another example, the
student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the
department chair, who acted on behalf of the university; all those
agents are responsible in some way for the activity that took place but
we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what
degree. </p>

<p>According to <a href="#starting-points">Section 2</a>, for an entity to be transformed from, created from, or resulting from an update to another, there must be some
underpinning activities performing the necessary actions resulting in such a derivation.  
A derivation can be described at various levels of precision. In its simplest form, derivation relates two entities. Optionally, attributes can be added to represent further information about the derivation.  If the derivation is the result of a single known activity, then this activity can also be optionally expressed. To provide a completely accurate description of the derivation, the generation and usage of the generated and used entities, respectively, can be provided.  Optional information such as activity, generation, and usage can be linked to derivations to aid analysis of provenance and to facilitate provenance-based reproducibility. </p>

</p>


<p> A trace relation between two entities  <span class="name">e2</span> and  <span class="name">e1</span> is a generic dependency of <span class="name">e2</span>
on  <span class="name">e1</span> that indicates either that <span class="name">e1</span> may have been necessary for <span class="name">e2</span> to be created, or that <span class="name">e1</span> bears 
some responsibility for  <span class="name">e2</span>'s existence.


<p>A <dfn title="tracedTo">Trace</dfn> relation <span class="withPn">, written <span class="pnExpression">tracedTo(id,e2,e1,attrs)</span> in PROV-N,</span> has:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class='attribute' id="trace.id">id</span>:  an OPTIONAL identifier identifying the relation;</li> 
<li><span class='attribute' id="trace.entity">entity</span>:  an identifier (<span class="name">e2</span>) for an entity;
<li><span class='attribute' id="trace.ancestor">ancestor</span>: an identifier (<span class="name">e1</span>) for an ancestor entity that the former depends on;
<li><span class='attribute' id="trace.attributes">attributes</span>: an OPTIONAL set (<span class="name">attrs</span>) of attribute-value pairs representing additional information about this relation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We note that the ancestor is allowed to be an agent since agents are entities. </p>

<p>
<a>Derivation</a> and <a>attribution</a> are particular cases of  trace.

<p>Wherever two people describe the provenance of a same thing, 
one cannot expect them to coordinate and agree on the identifiers to use to denote that thing.</p>
<div class="anexample" id="entity-example1">
<p>User Alice writes an article. In its provenance, she wishes to refer to the precise version of the article with a date-specific URI, as she might edit the article later. Alternatively, user Bob refers to the article in general, independently of its variants over time.</p>
</div>
<p>
To allow for identifiers to be chosen freely and independently by each  user, the PROV data model introduces relations
that allow entities  to be linked together.
The following two relations are introduced for expressing  specialized or alternate entities. </p>

<h3>Component 5: Collections</h3>

<p>The fifth component of PROV-DM is concerned with the notion of collections. 
A collection is an entity that has some members. The members are themselves entities, and therefore their provenance can be expressed. Some applications need to be able to express the provenance of the collection  itself: e.g. who maintains the collection, which members it contains as it evolves, and how it was assembled. The purpose of Component 5 is to define the types and relations that are useful to express the provenance of collections. In PROV, the concept of Collection is implemented by means of dictionaries, which we introduce in this section. </p>

<p>Figure <a href="#figure-component5">figure-component5</a> depicts
the fifth component with four new classes and three associations.
</p>


<div style="text-align: center;">
<figure>
<img src="images/Dictionaries.png" alt="dictionaries"/>
<figcaption id="figure-component5">Figure 9: Collections Component Overview</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>


<p>The intent of these relations and types is to express the <em>history of changes that occurred to a collection</em>. 
Changes to collections are about the insertion of entities in collections and the removal of members from collections.
Indirectly, such history provides a way to reconstruct the contents of a collection.</p>

<section id="term-collection">
<h3>Collection</h3>

<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-collection"></span>

<p>In PROV, the concept of Collection is  provided as an extensibility point for other kinds of collections. Collections are implemented by means of dictionaries, which are introduced next. </p>

</section>

<section id="term-dictinonary">
<h3>Dictionary</h3>


<p>PROV-DM defines a specific type of collection: a dictionary, specified as follows.</p>


<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-dictionary"></span>

<p>Conceptually, a dictionary has a logical structure consisting of key-entity pairs. This structure is often referred to as a <em>map</em>, and is a generic indexing mechanism that can abstract commonly used data structures, including associative lists (also known as "dictionaries" in some programming languages), relational tables, ordered lists, and more. The specification of such specialized structures in terms of key-value pairs is out of the scope of this document.</p>

<p>A given dictionary forms a given structure for its members.  A different structure (obtained either by insertion or removal of members) constitutes a different dictionary. Hence,
 for the purpose of provenance, a dictionary entity is viewed as a snapshot of a structure. Insertion and removal operations result in new snapshots, each snapshot forming an identifiable dictionary entity.</p>


<p>PROV-DM defines the following types related to dictionaries:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <span class="name">prov:Dictionary</span>  denotes an entity of type dictionary, i.e. an entity that  can participate in  relations amongst dictionaries;

  <li><span class="name">prov:EmptyDictionary</span> denotes an empty dictionary.
</ul>





<!--
In addition, the attribute  <span class="name">prov:content</span> is introduced to allow the explicit specification of the dictionary's content. The example below illustrates the syntax.
-->

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">
entity(d0, [prov:type="prov:EmptyDictionary" %% xsd:QName])  // d0 is an empty dictionary
entity(d1, [prov:type="prov:Dictionary"  %% xsd:QName])      // d1 is a dictionary, with unknown content

From this set of descriptions, we conclude:

<li>   <span class="name">d1</span> is the set <span class="name">{ ("k1", e1), ("k2", e2) }</span>
<li>   <span class="name">d2</span> is the set <span class="name">{ ("k1", e1), ("k2", e2), ("k3", e3) }</span>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Insertion provides an "update semantics" for the keys that are already present in a dictionary,
since a new pair replaces an existing pair with the same key in the new dictionary. This is illustrated by the following example.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">
entity(d0, [prov:type="prov:EmptyDictionary" %% xsd:QName])    // d0 is an empty dictionary

derivedByInsertionFrom(d1, d0, {("k1", e1), ("k2", e2)})       
derivedByInsertionFrom(d2, d1, {("k1", e3)})    
</pre>
   This is a case of <em>update</em> of <span class="name">e1</span> to <span class="name">e3</span> for the same key, <span class="name">"k1"</span>. <br/>
  From this set of descriptions, we conclude:

<h3>Membership</h3>


<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-membership"></span>

<p>
The insertion and removal  relations make insertions and removals explicit as part of the history of a dictionary. This, however, requires explicit mention of the state of the dictionary prior to each operation. The membership relation removes this needs, allowing the state of a dictionary <span class="name">c</span> to be expressed without having to introduce a prior state.</p>

<p>
<div class="attributes" id="attributes-memberOf">
 A <dfn title="memberOf">membership</dfn> relation, written <span class="pnExpression">memberOf(id, c, {(key_1, e_1), ..., (key_n, e_n)}, cplt, attrs)</span>, has:

<a title="value">Value</a> (<span class="name">cplt</span>); if true, it indicates that no other member belongs to the dictionary;  if false, it indicates that other members belong to the dictionary; if unspecified, other members MAY belong to the dictionary.
<li><span class='attribute' id="memberOf.attributes">attributes</span>: an OPTIONAL set (<span class="name">attrs</span>) of attribute-value pairs representing additional information about this relation.</li>
</ul>
</div>




<p>The description <span class="name">memberOf(c, {(key_1, e_1), ..., (key_n, e_n)})</span> states that  <span class="name">c</span> is known to include <span class="name">(key_1, e_1)</span>, ..., <span class="name">(key_n, e_n)}</span>, without having to introduce a previous state. </p>

</ul>
<p> Thus, the states of <span class="name">d1</span> and <span class="name">d3</span> are only partially known.</p>

  Note that the following one cannot have at the same time an empty dictionary and membership relations for it, i.e., the following example is invalid:
<pre class="codeexample">
  <span class="name"> entity(c, [prov:type="EmptyDictionary"])</span>
   memberOf(c, {("k1", e1), ("k2", v2)} )  
  </pre>


-->

</section>  <!-- Membership -->



<p>Further considerations: </p>

<ul>

<li>The state of a dictionary (i.e., the set of key-entity pairs it contains) at a given point in a sequence of operations is never stated explicitly. Rather, it can be obtained by querying the chain of derivations involving insertions and removals. Entity type <span class="name">emptyDictionary</span> can be used in this context as it marks the start of a sequence of dictionary operations.</li>


<li>The representation of a dictionary through these relations makes no assumption regarding the underlying data structure used to store and manage dictionaries. In particular, no assumptions are needed regarding the mutability of a data structure that is subject to updates. Entities, however, are immutable and this applies  to those entities that represent dictionaries. This is reflected in the constraints listed in [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]].  </li>

<h3>Component 6: Annotations</h3>

<p>The sixth component of PROV-DM is concerned with <a title="note">notes</a> and <a title="annotation">annotations</a>.
</p>

<p>As provenance descriptions are exchanged between systems, it may be useful for a third party to add extra information to what they are describing. For instance, a "trust service" may add value-judgements about the
trustworthiness of some of the entities or agents occurring in provenance records it is given access to. Likewise, an interactive visualization component may want to enrich an existing set of provenance descriptions with information helping reproduce their
visual representation. To help with interoperability, PROV-DM introduces a simple annotation mechanism allowing anything that is identifiable to be associated with notes.
For this, a type and and a relation are introduced.</p>


<p>The annotation mechanism (with note and annotation) forms a key aspect of the extensibility mechanism of PROV-DM (see <a

<h3>Further Elements of PROV-DM</h3>

This section introduces further elements of PROV-DM.

<section id="term-NamespaceDeclaration">
<h3>Namespace Declaration</h3>

<p>A PROV-DM <dfn id="dfn-namespace">namespace</dfn> is identified by an IRI [[!IRI]]. In PROV-DM, attributes, identifiers, and values with <a title="qualified name">qualified names</a> as data type can be placed in a namespace using the mechanisms described in this specification. </p>


<p>A <dfn id="dfn-namespaceDeclaration">namespace declaration</dfn> consists of a binding between a prefix and a namespace. Every qualified name with this prefix in the scope of this
declaration refers to this namespace. 
A <dfn id="dfn-defaultNamespaceDeclaration">default namespace declaration</dfn> consists of a namespace. Every un-prefixed qualified name in the scope of this default namespace declaration
refers to this namespace.</p>

<p>The <dfn title="prov-namespace">PROV namespace</dfn> is identified by the URI <span class="name">http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#</span>.</p>

</section>

<section id="term-qualified-name">
<h4>Qualified Name</h4>


<span class="glossary-ref" data-ref="glossary-qualifiedName"></span>

<p>PROV-DM stipulates that a qualified name can be mapped into an IRI
 by concatenating the IRI associated with the prefix and the local part.</p>

<p>A qualified name's prefix is OPTIONAL. If a prefix occurs in a
 qualified name, it refers to a <a>namespace</a> declared in a namespace declaration.  In the absence of prefix, the qualified name 
 refers to the <a title="default namespace declaration">default namespace</a>.</p>

</section>



<section id="term-identifier">
<h4>Identifier</h4>

<p>
An <dfn id="dfn-identifier">identifier</dfn> is a <a>qualified
 name</a>. 
</p>

</section>

<section id="term-attribute">
<h4>Attribute</h4>

<p>An <dfn title="dfn-attribute" id="dfn-attribute">attribute</dfn> is a <a>qualified name</a>. 


<p>The PROV data model introduces a pre-defined set of attributes in the <a title="prov-namespace">PROV namespace</a>, which we define below. 
This specification does not provide any interpretation for any attribute declared in any other namespace.</p>

</table>
</div>





<section id="term-attribute-label">
<h4>prov:label</h4>

<p> The attribute <dfn title="dfn-label"><span class="name">prov:label</span></dfn> provides a human-readable representation of a PROV-DM element or relation.  The value associated with the attribute <span class="name">prov:label</span> MUST be a string.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following entity is provided with a label attribute.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
 entity(ex:e1, [prov:label="This is a label"])
</pre>
</div>


</section>


<section id="term-attribute-location">
<h4>prov:location</h4>

<p>A <dfn title="dfn-Location">location</dfn> can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112), but it can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory, row, or column. As such, there are numerous ways in which location can be expressed, such as by a coordinate,
address, landmark, and so forth. This  document does not specify how to concretely express  locations, but instead provide a mechanism to introduce locations, by means of a reserved attribute. </p> 


<p>
The attribute <span class="name">prov:location</span> is an OPTIONAL attribute of entity, activity, usage, and generation.  The value associated with the  attribute <span class="name">prov:location</span> MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value</a>, expected to denote a location.
</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following expression describes entity Mona Lisa, a painting, with a location attribute. </p>
<pre class="codeexample">
 entity(ex:MonaLisa, [prov:location="Le Louvres, Paris", prov:type="StillImage"])
</pre>
</div>
</section>


<section id="term-attribute-role">
<h4>prov:role</h4>

<p>The attribute <dfn title="dfn-role"><span class="name">prov:role</span></dfn>  denotes the function of an entity with respect to an activity, in the context of a <a>usage</a>, <a>generation</a>,
 <a>association</a>,  <a>start</a>, and  <a>end</a>. The attribute <span class="name">prov:role</span> is allowed to occur multiple times in a list of attribute-value pairs. The value associated with a <span
class="name">prov:role</span> attribute MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value</a>.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following activity is associated with an agent acting as the operator. </p>
<pre class="codeexample">
 wasAssociatedWith(a, ag, [prov:role="operator"])
</pre>
</div>
</section>

<section id="term-attribute-type">
<h4>prov:type</h4>

<p>The attribute <dfn title="dfn-type"><span class="name">prov:type</span></dfn>  provides further typing information for an element or relation. PROV-DM liberally
defines a type as a category of things having common characteristics. PROV-DM is agnostic about the representation of types, and only states that
the value associated with a <span class="name">prov:type</span> attribute MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value.</a> The attribute <span class="name">prov:type</span>
is allowed to occur multiple times.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following describes an agent of type software agent.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
   agent(ag, [prov:type="prov:SoftwareAgent" %% xsd:QName])
</pre>
</div>

<p>The following types are pre-defined in PROV, and are valid values for the <span class="name">prov:type</span> attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="name">prov:Plan</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:Account</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:SoftwareAgent</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:Organization</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:Person</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:Collection</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:Dictionary</span></li>

<li><span class="name">prov:EmptyDictionary</span></li>

</ul>

</section>


<section id="term-attribute-value">
<h4>prov:value</h4>

<p>The attribute <dfn title="dfn-value"><span class="name">prov:value</span></dfn>  provides a <a title="value">Value</a> associated with an entity.</p>


<p>The attribute <span class="name">prov:value</span> is an OPTIONAL attribute of entity.  The value associated with the  attribute <span class="name">prov:value</span> MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value</a>. The attribute <span class="name">prov:value</span> MAY occur at most once in a set of attribute-value pairs.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following example illustrates the provenance of the number <span class="name">4</span> obtained by an activity that computed the length of an input string <span class="name">"abcd"</span>.
The input and the output are expressed as entities <span class="name">ex:in</span> and <span class="name">ex:out</span>, respectively. They each have a <span class="name">prov:value</span> attribute associated with the corresponding value.
</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
entity(ex:in, [prov:value="abcd"]) 
entity(ex:out, [prov:value=4])

</pre>
</div>

<div class="note">Should we also have prov:encoding?</div>

<section id="term-value">
<h4>Value</h4>

<p>
By means of attribute-value pairs, the PROV data model can refer to <dfn title="value">values</dfn> such as strings, numbers, time, qualified names, and IRIs.  
The interpretation of such values is outside the scope of PROV-DM.</p>
<p>Each kind of such values is called a <em>datatype</em>. The datatypes are taken from 
the set of XML Schema Datatypes, version 1.1 [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]] and the RDF specification [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]]. The normative definitions of these datatypes are provided by the respective specifications. 
Each datatype is identified by its XML <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#QName">xsd:QName</a>.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>We note that PROV-DM <dfn title="dfn-time">time instants</dfn> are defined according to xsd:dateTime [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]].</p>

    <section id="extensibility-section"> 
<h2>PROV-DM Extensibility Points</h2>


<p>The PROV data model provides extensibility points that allow designers to specialize it to specific applications or domains. We summarize these extensibility points here:

<ul>
<li> Attribute-value lists occur in all types and relations of the data model.  Applications designers are free to introduce further application-specific attributes. Attributes for a given application can be distinguished by qualifying them with a prefix denoting a namespace
declared in a namespace declaration.

<p>The <a title="prov-namespace">PROV namespace</a> declares a set of reserved attributes catering for extensibility: <a href="#term-attribute-type"><span class="name">prov:type</span></a>, <a href="#term-attribute-role"><span class="name">prov:role</span></a>, <a href="#term-attribute-location"><span
class="name">prov:location</span></a>.</li>

<li>Sub-types and sub-relations can be expressed by means of the reserved attribute 
<a href="#term-attribute-type"><span class="name">prov:type</span></a>.

<div class="anexample" id="anexample-sub-relation">
<p>
In the following example,  <span class="name">e2</span> is a translation of <span class="name">e1</span>,
expressed as a sub-type of derivation.
<pre class="codeexample"> 
  wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1, [prov:type="ex:Translation" %% xsd:QName])
</pre>
</div>

<div class="anexample" id="anexample-sub-type">
<p>
In the following example,  <span class="name">e</span> is described as a Car, a type of entity.
<pre class="codeexample"> 
  entity(e, [prov:type="ex:Car" %% xsd:QName])
</pre>
</div>




</li>





<li>New namespaces and associated prefixes can be declared, allowing attributes and names to be qualified. </li>

<li>Notes allow arbitrary metadata to be associated with anything identifiable in PROV-DM. Notes consist of attribute-value pairs.  Attributes are qualified by a
namespace.</li>

</ul>

<p>The PROV data model is designed to be application and technology independent, but specializations of PROV-DM are welcome and encouraged.  To ensure interoperability, specializations of
the PROV data model that exploit the extensibility points summarized in this section MUST preserve the semantics specified in this document and in [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]]. </p>



    </section> 



<section id="valid-provenance">
<h4>Creating Valid Provenance</h4>


<ul>

<li>This specification defines PROV-DM, a data model that allows 
descriptions of the people, institutions, entities, and activities,
involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a
thing to be expressed.  However, with this data model, it is also possible to compose
descriptions that would not make sense: for instance, one could
express that an entity was used before it was generated, or that the
activity that generated an entity began its existence after the entity
generation.  A set of constraints have been defined for PROV-DM and
can be found in a companion specification [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]].
They SHOULD be used by developers to compose provenance descriptions that are valid, and
by implementers of reasoning engines aiming to check whether provenance descriptions have problems. </li>



<li>
<p> The example of <a href="#prov-dm-example">section 3</a> contains identifiers such as <span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</a></span>, which denotes a specific version of a technical report.  On the other hand, a URI such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/</a> denotes the latest version of a document. One needs to ensure that provenance descriptions for the latter resource remain valid as the resource state changes. </p>

<p>To this end, PROV-DM allows asserters to describe "<em>partial states</em>" of entities by means of attributes and associated values. Some further constraints apply to the use of these attributes, since the values associated with them are expected to remain unchanged for some period of time. The constraints associated to attributes allow provenance descriptions to be refined, they can also be found in the companion specification [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]].</p>


</li>


<li>
<p>The idea of bundling provenance descriptions is crucial to the PROV approach. Indeed, it allows multiple provenance perspectives to be provided for a given entity. It is also the mechanism by which provenance of provenance can be expressed. Such a named bundle is referred to as an <dfn>account</dfn> and is regarded as an <a title="concept-account">Account</a> so that its provenance can be expressed.   The notion of account is specified in the companion specification [[PROV-CONSTRAINTS]], as well as the constraints that  <dfn>structurally well-formed</dfn> descriptions SHOULD satisfy.</p>
</li>
