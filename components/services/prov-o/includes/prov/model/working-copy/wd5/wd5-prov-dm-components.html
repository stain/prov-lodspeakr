PROV-DM is a data model for provenance that describes
the entities, people and activities involved in
producing a piece of data or thing in the world. PROV-DM is
domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing
further domain-specific and application-specific extensions to be
defined.  PROV-DM is accompanied by PROV-N, a technology-independent
notation, which allows serializations of PROV-DM
instances to be created for human consumption, which facilitates the
mapping of PROV-DM to concrete syntax, and which is used as the basis for a
formal semantics of PROV-DM.

      <h2>Introduction<br>
</h2> 

<p> 
For the purpose of this specification, <dfn>provenance</dfn> is defined as a record that describes the people,
institutions, entities, and activities, involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world.
In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding
whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its
originators when reusing it.  In an open and inclusive environment
such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or
questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
</p>


<p>
The idea that a single way of representing and collecting provenance could be adopted internally by all systems does not seem to be realistic today. Instead, a pragmatic approach is to
consider a core data model for provenance that allows  domain and application specific representations of provenance to be translated into such a data model and exchanged between systems.
Heterogeneous systems can then export their provenance into such a core data model, and applications that need to make sense of provenance in heterogeneous systems can then import it,
process it, and reason over it.</p>

<p>Thus, the vision is that different provenance-aware systems natively adopt their own model for representing their provenance, but a core provenance data model can be readily adopted as a
provenance <em>interchange</em> model across such systems.</p>

<p>A set of specifications, referred to as the PROV family of specifications, define the various aspects
that are necessary to achieve this vision in an interoperable
way:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data model for provenance, which is presented in three documents:
<ul>
<li> PROV-DM (part I): the provenance data model itself, expressed in natural language (this document);
<li> PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS (part II): constraints underpinning the data model [[PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS]];
<li> PROV-N (part III): a notation to express instances of that data model for human consumption [[PROV-N]];
</ul> 
</li>

<li>PROV-O: a normative serialization of PROV-DM in RDF [[!PROV-O]], specified by means of a mapping to the OWL2 Web Ontology Language [[!OWL2-SYNTAX]];</li>
<li>PROV-AQ: the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance [[PROV-AQ]];</li>
<li>PROV-PRIMER: a primer for the PROV approach [[PROV-PRIMER]];</li>
<li>PROV-SEM: semantics of the PROV-DM data model [[PROV-SEM]];</li>
</ul>


<p>
The PROV-DM data model for provenance consists of a set of core
concepts, and a few common relations, based on these core concepts.  PROV-DM is a domain-agnostic model, but with clear extensibility points allowing further domain-specific and
application-specific extensions to be defined.</p>

<p>This specification intentionally presents the key concepts of the PROV Data Model, without drilling down into all its subtleties.  Using these key concepts, it becomes possible to write useful provenance assertions very quickly, and publish or embed them along side the data they relate to. </p>

<p>However, if data changes, then it is challenging to express its provenance precisely, like it would be for any other form of metadata. To address this challenge, an <em>upgrade path</em> is proposed to enrich simple provenance, with extra-descriptions that  help qualify the specific subject of provenance and provenance itself, with attributes and interval, intended to satisfy a comprehensive set of constraints.  These aspects are covered in the companion specification [[PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS]].

    <section id='conceptualization'> 
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This section provides an overview of the main concepts found in the PROV data model. </p>


  
    <section id='section-entity-activity-agent'> 
<h2>Entity, Activity, Agent</h2>


<p>PROV-DM is a data model for describing the provenance of <em>Entities</em>, that is, of things in the world. The term "Things" encompasses a broad diversity of concepts, including digital objects such as a file or web page, 
physical things such as a building or a printed book, or a car as well as abstract concepts and ideas. One can regard any Web resource as an example of Entity in this context. </p>

<p>
<div class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-entity"  withspan="true">
</div>



<div class="anexample" id="entity-example">
<p>An entity may be the document at URI <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/</a>, a file in a file system, a car or an idea.</p>
</div>



<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-activity"  withspan="true"></span> Activities that operate on digital entities may for example move, copy, or duplicate them.
</p>



<div class="anexample" id="activity-example">
<p>An activity may be the publishing of a document on the web, sending a twitter message, extracting metadata embedded in a file, or driving a car from Boston to Cambridge, assembling a data set based on a set of measurements, performing a statistical analysis over a data set, sorting news items according to some criteria, running a SPARQL query over a triple store, and editing a file.</p>
</div>


<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-agent"  withspan="true">
</span>
</p>


<p>The motivation for introducing  agents in the model is to denote the agent's responsibility for activities. 
The definition of agent intentionally stays away from using concepts such as enabling, causing, initiating, affecting, etc, because many entities also enable, cause, initiate, and affect in some way
the activities. Concepts such as initiating are themselves defined as relations between agent and activities.   So the notion of having some degree of responsibility is really what makes an agent.</p>


<p>An agent is a particular type of Entity. This means that the model can be
 used to express provenance of the agents themselves.  </p>

<div class="anexample" id="agent-example">
<p>
Software for checking the use of grammar in a document may be defined as an agent of a document preparation activity, and at the same time one can describe its provenance, including for instance the vendor and the version history.</p>
</div>
</section>



    <section id="section-generation-usage-derivation"> 
<h2>Generation, Usage, Derivation</h2>

<p>Activities and entities are associated with each other in two different ways: activities are consumers of entities and activities are producers of entities. The act of producing or consuming an entity may have a duration.  
 The term 'generation' refers to the completion of the the act of producing; likewise, the term 'usage' refers to the beginning of the act of consuming entities. Thus, we define the following notions of generation and usage. </p>

<p>
<div class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-generation"  withspan="true">
</div>


<p>
<div class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-usage"  withspan="true">
</div>




<p><div class="anexample" id="generation-example">
Examples of generation are the completed creation of a file by a
program, the completed creation of a linked data set, and the completed
publication of a new version of a document.
</div>


<p>
<div class="anexample" id="usage-example">
Usage examples include a procedure beginning to consume an argument, a service starting to read a value on a port, a program beginning to read a configuration
file, or the point at which an ingredient, such as eggs, is being added in a baking activity. Usage may entirely consume an entity (e.g. eggs are no longer available after being added to
the mix); alternatively, a same entity may be used multiple times, possibly by different activities (e.g. a file on a file system can be read indefinitely).
</div>


<p>Activities are consumers of entities and producers of entities. In some case, the consumption of an entity influences the creation of another in some way. This notion is captured by derivations, defined as follows.</p>

<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-derivation"  withspan="true"></span>



<div class="anexample" id="derivation-example">
<p>Examples of derivation include  the transformation of a relational table into a
linked data set, the transformation of a canvas into a painting, the transportation of a work of art from London to New York, and a physical transformation such as the melting of ice into water.</p>
</div>

</section>

    <section id="section-types-entities-agents"> 
<h2>Types of Entities and Agents</h2>

<p>There are some useful types of entities and agents that are commonly encountered in applications making data and documents available on the Web; we introduce them in this section. </p>

<p>
<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-plan"  withspan="true">
</span>
PROV-DM is not
prescriptive about the nature of plans, their representation, the
actions or steps they consist of, or their intended goals.  Since plans may evolve over time,
it may become necessary to track their provenance, so plans themselves are
entities. Representing the plan explicitly in the provenance can be useful for various tasks: for example, to  
validate the execution as represented in the provenance record, to  
manage expectation failures, or to provide explanations.</p>

<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-collection"  withspan="true"></span> This concept allows for the provenance of the collection, but also of its constituents to be expressed.  Such a notion of collection corresponds to a wide variety of  concrete data structures, such as a <em>maps</em>, <em>dictionaries</em> or <em>associative arrays</em>.</p>

<div class="anexample" id="collection-example">
<p>
An example of collection is an archive of documents. Each document has its own provenance, but the archive itself also has some provenance: who maintained it, which documents it contained at which point in time, how it was assembled, etc.

<p>
Having found a resource, a user may want to retrieve its
provenance. For users to decide whether they can place their trust in
that resource, they may want to analyze its provenance, but also determine
who the provenance is attributed to, and when it was
generated. Hence, from the PROV-DM data model, the provenance is
regarded as an entity, an AccountEntity, for which provenance can be
sought.

<p>Three types of agents are recognized by PROV-DM because they are commonly encountered in applications making data and documents available on the Web: persons, software agents, and organizations.</p>

<div class="anexample" id="software-agents-example">
<p> Even software agents can be assigned some responsibility for the effects they have in the world, so for example if one is using a Text Editor and one's laptop crashes, then one would say
that the Text Editor was responsible for crashing the laptop.  If one invokes a service to buy a book, that service can be considered responsible for drawing funds from one's bank to make
the purchase (the company that runs the service and the web site would also be responsible, but the point here is that we assign some measure of responsibility to software as well). </p>
</div>
<p>So when
someone models software as an agent for an activity in the PROV-DM model, they mean the agent has some responsibility for that activity.</p>

<h2>Activity Association and Responsibility</h2>

  



<p>
Agents are defined as having some kind of responsibility for activities. However, one may want to be more specific about the nature of an agent's responsibility. 
For example, a programmer and a researcher could both be
associated with running a workflow, but it may not matter which
programmer clicked the button to start the workflow while it would
matter a lot which researcher told the programmer to do so.  So there
is some notion of responsibility that needs to be captured. </p>

-->


<p>Provenance reflects activities that have occurred.  In some  
cases, those activities reflect the execution of a plan that was  
designed in advance to guide the execution.  PROV-DM allows associating
a plan to an activity, which represents what was intended to  
happen.  </p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium publishes many technical reports. In this example, we consider a technical report, and describe its provenance. </p>

<p>Specifically, we consider the second version of the PROV-DM document 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215</a>. Its provenance can be expressed from several perspectives, which we present. In the first one,  provenance is concerned with the W3C process, whereas in the second one, it takes the authors' viewpoint.  </p>


<section id="section-example-a"> 
<h3>The Process View</h3>


<p style="font-style:italic; " ><b>Description:</b> The World Wide Web
Consortium publishes technical reports according to its publication
policy.  Working drafts are published regularly to reflect the work
accomplished by working groups. Every publication of a working draft
must be preceded by a "publication request" to the Webmaster.  The
very first version of a technical report must also preceded by a
"transition request" to be approved by the W3C director.  All working
drafts are made available at a unique URI.  In this scenario, we consider two successive versions of a given report, the policy according they were published, and the associated requests.
</p>

<p>

Concretely, in this section, we describe the kind of provenance record that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium">WWW Consortium</a> could keep for auditors to check that due processes are followed. All entities involved in this example are Web resources, with well defined URIs (some of which locating archived email messages, available to W3C Members).</p>

<ul>
<li> Two versions of the technical report are involved: <span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</a></span> (second working draft) and <span class="name"><span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111018</a></span></span> (first working draft);</li>
<li> Both <span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</a></span> and <span class="name"><span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111018</a></span></span> were published by the WWW Consortium  agent (<span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium">w3:Consortium</a></span>); </li>
<li> The publication activity for <span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</a></span> is <span class="name">ex:act2</span>;</li>

</ul>

<p>
We now paraphrase some PROV-DM descriptions, and illustrate them with the PROV-N notation, a notation for PROV-DM aimed at human consumption.  We then follow them with a graphical illustration. Full details of the provenance record can be found <a href="examples/w3c-publication1.prov-n">here</a>.

<ul>
<li>There is a technical report, a working draft on the recommendation track (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsWD">pr:RecsWD</a>), which is regarded as an entity so that we can describe its provenance. Similar descriptions exist for all entities.
<pre>
entity(tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215, [ prov:type="pr:RecsWD" %% xsd:QName ])
</pre>
</li>
<li>There is a publication activity.

<li>The technical report was generated by the publication activity: this is a <a title="concept-Generation">Generation</a>.
<pre>

</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Provenance descriptions can be <em>illustrated</em> graphically. The illustration is not intended to represent all the details of the model, but it is intended to show the essence of a set of
provenance statements.  Therefore, it should not be seen as an alternate notation for expressing provenance.</p>

<p>The graphical illustration takes the form of a graph. Entities, activities and agents are represented as nodes, with oval, rectangular, and octagonal shapes, respectively.  Usage,
Generation, Derivation, and Activity Association are represented as directed edges.</p>

<p>Entities are laid out according to the ordering of their generation event.  We endeavor to show time progressing from top to bottom. This means that edges for Usage, Generation and
Derivation typically point upwards.</p>

<p> This simple example has shown a variety of PROV-DM constructs, such as Entity, Agent, Activity, Usage, Generation, Derivation, and ActivityAssociation. In this example, it happens that all entities were already Web resources, with readily available URIs, which we used. We note that some of the resources are public, whereas others have restricted access: provenance statements only make use of their identifiers. If identifiers do not pre-exist, e.g. for activities, then they can be generated, for instance <span class="name">ex:act2</span>, occurring in the namespace identified by prefix <span class="name">ex</span>.  We note that the URI scheme developed by W3C is particularly suited for expressing provenance of these reports, since each URI denotes a specific version of a report. It then becomes very easy to relate the various versions, with PROV-DM constructs. </p>

<h3>Attribution of Provenance</h3>

<p>The two previous sections  provide  two different perspectives on the provenance of a technical report. By design, the PROV approach allows for the provenance of a subject to be provided by multiple sources. For users to decide whether they can place their trust in the technical report, they may want to analyze its provenance, but also determine
who the provenance is attributed to, and when it was
generated, etc. In other words, we need to be able to express the provenance of provenance.</p>

<p>No new mechanism is required to support this requirement.  PROV-DM makes the assumption that provenance statements have been bundled up, and named, by some mechanism outside the scope of PROV-DM. For instance, in this case, provenance statements were put in a file and exposed on the Web, respectively at <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/working-copy/examples/w3c-publication1.pn">ex:prov1</a> and <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/working-copy/examples/w3c-publication3.pn">ex:prov3</a>.   To express their respective provenance, these resources must be seen as entities, and all the constructs of PROV-DM are now available to characterize their provenance. In the example below, <span class="name">ex:prov1</span> is attributed to the agent <span class="name">w3:Consortium</span>, whereas <span class="name">ex:prov3</span> to <span class="name">ex:Simon</span>.

<pre>
entity(ex:prov1, [prov:type="prov:AccountEntity" %% xsd:QName ])
wasAttributedTo(ex1:prov1,w3:Consortium)

entity(ex:prov3, [prov:type="prov:AccountEntity" %% xsd:QName ])
wasAttributedTo(ex1:prov3,ex:Simon)

<h2>PROV-DM Concepts and Relations</h2>

<p>PROV-DM Concepts are structured according to six components that are introduced here.
Components and their dependencies are illustrated in Figure <a href="#prov-dm-components">prov-dm-components</a>. A component that relies on concepts defined in another also sits above it, in this figure.
PROV-DM consists of the following components.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Component 1: entities and activities.</b> The first component consists of entities, activities, and all concepts linking them, such as generation, usage, start, end. The first component is the only one comprising time-related concepts. </li>
<li><b>Component 2: agents and responsibility.</b> The second component consists of agents and concepts ascribing responsibility to agents.</li>
<li><b>Component 3: derivations.</b>  The third component is formed with derivations and its subtypes.</li>
<li><b>Component 4: alternate.</b> The fourth component consists of relations linking entities somehow denoting a same thing. </li>
<li><b>Component 5: collections.</b> The fifth component is comprised of collections and operations related to collections. </li>
<li><b>Component 6: annotations.</b> The sixth component is concerned with annotations to PROV-DM  concepts.</li>
</ol>

While  not all PROV-DM relations are binary, they all involve two primary elements. Hence, Table <a href="#relations-at-a-glance">relations-at-a-glance</a> indexes all relations according to their two primary elements.  The table adopts the same color scheme as in Figure <a href="#prov-dm-components">prov-dm-components</a>, allowing components to be readily identified.

<h3>Component 1: Entities and Activities</h3>

<p>The first component of PROV-DM is concerned with <a title="entity">entities</a> and <a title="activity">activities</a>, and their inter-relations: <a>Usage</a>, <a>Generation</a>, <a>Start</a>, <a>End</a>, <a>Communication</a>, and <a>Start by Activity</a>. Figure <a href="#figure-component1">figure-component1</a> overviews the first component, with two classes and binary associations between them. Associations are not just binary; indeed, <a>Usage</a>, <a>Generation</a>, <a>Start</a>, <a>End</a> are remarkable because they have  <em>time</em> attributes, which are placeholders for time information related to provenance.

<p>Further considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sets of Activities and Entities are disjoint, as described below.</li>
</ul>


<div class='issue'>The characterization interval of an entity is currently implicit. Making it explicit would allow us to define wasComplementOf more precisely. 
Beginning and end of characterization interval could be expressed by attributes (similarly to activities). 
How do we define the end of an entity? This is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/track/issues/204">ISSUE-204</a>.

<p>Further considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>An activity is not an entity. This distinction is similar to the distinction between 
'continuant' and 'occurrent' in logic [[Logic]].

<p>
In some cases, we may want to record the time at which an entity was generated without having to specify the activity that generated it.

<p>
From an interoperability perspective, it is useful to define some basic categories of agents since
it will improve the use of provenance by applications.  
There should be very few of these basic categories to keep the model simple and accessible. 
There are three types of agents in the model since they are common across most anticipated domains of use:
<ul>
<li><span class="name">Person</span>: agents of type Person are people.</li> 
<li><span class="name">Organization</span>: agents of type Organization are social institutions such as companies, societies etc.</li> 
<li><span class="name">SoftwareAgent</span>: a software agent is a piece of software. </li>
</ul>
<p>These types are mutually exclusive, though they do not cover all kinds of agent. </p>



<div class="anexample">
<p>The following expression is about an agent identified by <span class="name">e1</span>, which is a person, named Alice, with employee number 1234.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">

Thus, this relation is useful when the activity is not known, or irrelevant.</p>

<h4>Responsibility</h4>

<div class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-responsibility"></div>

<p>PROV-DM offers a mild version of responsibility
in the form of a relation to represent when an agent acted on another
agent's behalf.  So in the example of someone running a mail program,
the program is an agent of that activity and the person is also an
agent of the activity, but we would also add that the mail software
agent is running on the person's behalf.  In the other example, the
student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the
department chair, who acts on behalf of the university, and all those
agents are responsible in some way for the activity to take place but
we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what
degree. </p>

<p>We could also say that an agent can act on behalf of several other
agents (a group of agents).  This would also make possible to
indirectly reflect chains of responsibility.  This also indirectly
reflects control without requiring that control is explicitly
indicated.  In some contexts there will be a need to represent
responsibility explicitly, for example to indicate legal
responsibility, and that could be added as an extension to this core
model.  Similarly with control, since in particular contexts there
might be a need to define specific aspects of control that various
agents exert over a given activity.</p>

<p><div class="attributes" id="attributes-responsibility-chain">A <dfn title="actedOnBehalfOf">responsibility</dfn> relation<span class="withPn">, written <span class="pnExpression">actedOnBehalfOf(id,ag2,ag1,a,attrs)</span> in PROV-N,</span> has the following constituents:

<li><span class='attribute' id="responsibility.id">id</span>:  an OPTIONAL identifier for the responsibility chain;</li> 
<li><span class='attribute' id="responsibility.subordinate">subordinate</span>: an identifier for the agent associated with an activity, acting on behalf of the responsible

<li><span class='attribute' id="responsibility.attributes">attributes</span>: an OPTIONAL set of attribute-value pairs that describe the modalities of this relation.</li>
</ul></div>


<div class="anexample">
In the following example, a programmer, a researcher and a funder agents are described.  The programmer and researcher are associated with a workflow activity.  The programmer acts on behalf
of the researcher (delegation) encoding the commands specified by the researcher; the researcher acts on behalf of the funder, who has an contractual agreement with the researcher. The terms
'delegation' and 'contact' used in this example are domain specific.

<h4>Derivation</h4>





<div class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-derivation"></div>




<p>According to <a href="#conceptualization">Section Overview</a>, for an entity to be transformed from, created from, or resulting from an update to another, there must be some
underpinning activities performing the necessary actions resulting in such a derivation.  
A derivation can be described at various levels of precision. In its simplest form, derivation relates two entities. Optionally, attributes can be added to describe modalities of derivation.  If the derivation is the result of a single known activity, then this activity can also be optionally expressed. And to provide a completely accurate description of derivation, the generation and usage of the generated and used entities, respectively, can be provided. The reason for optional information such as activity, generation, and usage to be linked to derivations is to aid analysis of provenance and to facilitate provenance-based reproducibility. </p>


<p><div class="attributes" id="attributes-derivation">A <dfn title="wasDerivedFrom">derivation</dfn><span class="withPn">, written <span class="pnExpression" id="pn-wasDerivedFrom">wasDerivedFrom(id, e2, e1, a, g2, u1, attrs)</span> in PROV-N,</span> contains:

<li><span class='attribute' id="derivation.generatedEntity">generatedEntity</span>: the identifier of the entity generated by the derivation;</li>
<li><span class='attribute' id="derivation.usedEntity">usedEntity</span>: the identifier of the entity used by the derivation;</li>
<li><span class='attribute' id="derivation.activity">activity</span>: an OPTIONAL identifier for the activity using and generating the above entities;</li>
<li><span class='attribute' id="derivation.generation">generation</span>: an OPTIONAL identifier for the generation involving the generated entity and activity;</li>

<li><span class='attribute' id="derivation.attributes">attributes</span>: an OPTIONAL set of attribute-value pairs that describe the modalities of this derivation.</li>

<p> Derivation is not defined to be transitive. Domain-specific specializations of derivation may be defined in such a way that the transitivity property
holds.</p>

The first and second lines are about derivations between  <span class="name">e2</span> and  <span class="name">e1</span>, but no information is provided as to the identity of the activity (and usage and generation) underpinning the derivation. In the second line, a type attribute is also provided.</p>
<p>
The third description expresses that activity  <span class="name">a</span>, 
using the entity <span class="name">e1</span> according to usage <span class="name">u1</span>,
 derived the
entity <span class="name">e2</span> and generated it according to generation
 <span class="name">g2</span>. It is followed by descriptions for generation <span class="name">g2</span> and usage <span class="name">u1</span>. With such a comprehensive description of derivation, a program that analyzes provenance can identify the activity underpinning the derivation, it can identify how the original entity <span class="name">e1</span> was used by  the activity (e.g. for instance, which argument it was passed as, if the activity is the result of a function invocation), and which output the derived entity <span class="name">e2</span> was obtained from (say, for a function returning multiple results).</p>

<h3>Component 5: Collections</h3>


<p><strong>Collection relations and entity types</strong> address the need to describe the evolution of entities that have a collection structure, that is, which may contain other entities. The intent of these relations and entity types is to capture the <em>history of changes that occurred to a collection</em>. Indirectly, such history provides a way to reconstruct, with some limitations discussed <a href="#term-collection-state">below</a>, the contents of a collection entity. Thus, for the purpose of provenance a collection entity is viewed an immutable representation of the state of a collection data structure, following a sequence of insertion and deletion operations.

<br/>A collection entity is an entity that has a logical internal structure consisting of key-value pairs, often referred to as a <strong>map</strong>. This collection type provides a generic indexing structure that can be used to model commonly used data structures, including associative lists (also known as "dictionaries" in some programming languages), relational tables, ordered lists, and more (the specification of such specialized structures in terms of key-value pairs is out of the scope of this document).

<section id="term-collection-types">
<h3>Collection types</h3>

The following new entity types are introduced:

<ul>
  <li> <span class="name">prov:Collection</span>  denotes an entity of type collection, i.e. an entity that  can participate in  relations amongst collections;

  <li><span class="name">prov:EmptyCollection</span> denotes an empty collection.

<h3>Membership</h3>

The insertion and removal relations make insertions and removals explicit as part of the history of a collection. This, however, requires explicit mention of the state of the collection prior to each insertion. The membership relation removes this needs, allowing the state of a collection <span class="name">c</span> to be asserted without having to introduce a prior state. This allows for the natural expression of a collection state, for instance in cases where a program or workflow block produces a new collection <span class="name">c</span>  with known content. In such cases, 
<span class="name">memberOf(c,{(key_1, value_1), ..., (key_n, value_n)})</span> asserts that  <span class="name">c</span> is known to include <span class="name">{(key_1, value_1), ..., (key_n, value_n)}</span>, without having to introduce an initial state. <br/>

<!--
This relation is introduced as a convenience, as it can be rewritten as an insertion operation by introducing a prior state:  <br/>
<span class="name">contained(c,k, v)</span> iff there exists a collection <span class="name">c0</span>  such that <span class="name">derivedByInsertionFrom(c, c0, k, v)</span>.

<h3>State of collections and use of weaker <a href="#Derivation-Relation">derivation</a> relation</h3>

<p>The state of a collection is only known to the extent that a chain of derivations starting from an empty collection can be found. Since a set of assertions regarding a collection's evolution may be incomplete, so is the reconstructed state obtained by querying those assertions. In general, all assertions reflect partial knowledge reagrding a sequence of data transformation events. In the particular case of collection evolution, in which some of the state changes may have been missed, the more generic  <a href="#Derivation-Relation">derivation</a> relation should be used to signal that some updates may have occurred, which cannot be precisely asserted as insertions or removals. The following two examples illustrate this.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">
  entity(c, [prov:type="collection"])    // c is a collection, possibly not empty
  entity(v1)
  entity(v2, [prov:type="collection"])    // v2 is a collection

 derivedByInsertionFrom(c1, c, k1, v1)       
   derivedByInsertionFrom(c2, c1, k2, v2)    
 </pre>
     From this set of assertions, we conclude:
   <pre class="codeexample">
    c1 includes (k1,v1) but may contain additional unknown pairs
    c2 includes (k1,v1), (k2 v2) (and possibly more pairs), where v2 is a collection with unknown state
   </pre>
 
 </div>
   In the example, the state of <span class="name">c2</span> is only partially known because the collection is constructed from partially known other collections.
 
 <div class="anexample">
 <pre class="codeexample">
   entity(c, [prov:type="emptyCollection"])    // c is an empty collection
   entity(v1)
   entity(v2)
   entity(c1, [prov:type="collection"])    
   entity(c2, [prov:type="collection"])    
   entity(c3, [prov:type="collection"])    
 
   derivedByInsertionFrom(c1, c, k1, v1)       
   wasDerivedFrom(c2, c1)                       
   derivedByInsertionFrom(c3, c2, k2, v2)       
 </pre>
     From this set of assertions, we conclude:
   <pre class="codeexample">
    c1 = { (k1,v1) }
    c2 is somehow derived from c1, but the precise sequence of updates is unknown
    c3  includes  (k2 v2) but the earlier "gap" leaves uncertainty regarding  (k1,v1) <br/>  (it may have been removed) or any other pair that may have been added as part of the derivation activities.
   </pre>
 </div>

Further considerations: <p/>

<ul>
<li>In Key-Value pairs, Keys are <a href="#term-value">values</a>, and Values are entities. This allows expressing nested collections, that is, collections whose values include entities of type collection.</li>

<li>As the relation names suggest, insertion and removal relations are a particular case of <a href="#Derivation-Relation">derivation</a>.</li>



<li>The state of a collection (i.e., the set of key-value pairs it contains) at a given point in a sequence of operations is never stated explicitly. Rather, it can be obtained by querying the chain of derivations involving insertions and removals. Entity type <span class="name">emptyCollection</span> can be used in this context as it marks the start of a sequence of collection operations.</li>


<li>The representation of a collection through these relations, makes no assumption regarding the underlying data structure used to store and manage collections. In particular, no assumptions are needed regarding the mutability of a data structure that is subject to updates. Entities, however, are immutable and this applies  to those entities that represent collections. This is reflected in the constraints listed in Part II.  </li>

<h3>Component 6: Annotations</h3>

<p>The sixth component of PROV-DM is concerned with <a title="note">notes</a> and <a title="annotation">annotations</a>.
</p>


   <section id="term-note"> 
      
<h4>Note</h4>

<p>As provenance descriptions are exchanged between systems, it may be useful to add extra-information to what they are describing. For instance, a "trust service" may add value-judgements about the
trustworthiness of some of the entities or agents involved. Likewise, an interactive visualization component may want to enrich a set of provenance descriptions with information helping reproduce their
visual representation. To help with interoperability, PROV-DM introduces a simple annotation mechanism allowing anything that is identifiable to be associated with notes.</p>

<p><div class="attributes" id="attributes-note">A <dfn>note</dfn><span class="withPn">, noted <span class="pnExpression">note(id, [ attr1=val1, ...])</span> in PROV-N,</span> contains:
<ul>
<li><span class='attribute' id="note.id">id</span>: an identifier for a note;</li>
<li><span class='attribute' id="note.attributes">attributes</span>: a set of attribute-value pairs, whose meaning is application specific.</li>
</ul></div>




<p>A separate PROV-DM relation is used to associate a note with something that is identifiable (see <a href="#term-annotation">Section on annotation</a>). A given note may be associated with
multiple identifiable things.
</p>


<div class="anexample" id="anexample-note1">
<p>
The following note consists of a set of application-specific attribute-value pairs, intended
to help the rendering of what it is associated with, by
specifying its color and its position on the screen.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
note(ex2:n1,[ex2:color="blue", ex2:screenX=20, ex2:screenY=30])
hasAnnotation(tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215,ex2:n1)

<p>The note is associated with the entity <span class="name">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</span> previously introduced (<a title="annotation">hasAnnotation</a> is 
discussed in Section <a href="#term-annotation">Annotation</a>).  The note's identifier and attributes are declared in a separate namespace denoted by prefix <span class="name">ex2</span>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="anexample" id="anexample-note2">
<p>Alternatively, a reputation service may enrich a provenance record with notes providing reputation ratings about agents. In the following fragment, both agents <span class="name">ex:Simon</span> and <span class="name">ex:Paolo</span> are rated "excellent".</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
note(ex3:n2,[ex3:reputation="excellent"])

<h4>Annotation</h4>



<span class="glossary-ref" ref="glossary-annotation"></span>

<p>Multiple notes can
be associated with a given identified object; symmetrically, multiple objects can be associated with a given note.  Since notes have identifiers,  they can also be
annotated. The annotation mechanism (with note and annotation) forms a key aspect of the extensibility mechanism of PROV-DM (see <a

<p></p><div class="attributes" id="attributes-annotation">An <dfn title="hasAnnotation">annotation relation</dfn><span class="withPn">, written <span class="pnExpression">hasAnnotation(r,n)</span> in PROV-N,</span> has the following constituents:

includes an activity, its usage of the first entity, and its generation of the second entity. The <a title="dfn-usage">usage</a> is annotated with a style (an application specific way

<h3>Further Elements of PROV-DM</h3>

This section introduces further elements of PROV-DM.

<section id="term-NamespaceDeclaration">
<h3>Namespace Declaration</h3>

<p>A PROV-DM <dfn id="dfn-namespace">namespace</dfn> is identified by an IRI reference [[!IRI]]. In PROV-DM, attributes, identifiers, and values with <a title="qualified name">qualified names</a> as data type can be placed in a namespace using the mechanisms described in this specification. </p>


<p>A <dfn id="dfn-namespaceDeclaration">namespace declaration</dfn> consists of a binding between a prefix and a namespace. Every qualified name with this prefix in the scope of this
declaration refers to this namespace. 
A <dfn id="dfn-defaultNamespaceDeclaration">default namespace declaration</dfn> consists of a namespace. Every un-prefixed qualified name in the scope of this default namespace declaration
refers to this namespace.</p>

<p>The PROV-DM namespace is <span class="name">http://www.w3.org/ns/prov-dm/</span> (TBC).</p>

</section>

<section id="term-identifier">
<h4>Identifier</h4>

<p>
An <dfn id="dfn-identifier">identifier</dfn> is a <a>qualified
 name</a>. 
</p>

<p>
A <dfn id="dfn-qualifiedName">qualified name</dfn> is a name subject to <a>namespace</a> interpretation. It consists of a <a>namespace</a>, denoted by an optional prefix, and a local name.</p>


<p>PROV-DM stipulates that a qualified name can be mapped into an IRI
 by concatenating the IRI associated with the prefix and the local part.</p>

<p>A qualified name's prefix is OPTIONAL. If a prefix occurs in a
 qualified name, it refers to a <a>namespace</a> declared in a namespace declaration.  In the absence of prefix, the qualified name 
 refers to the <a title="default namespace declaration">default namespace</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="term-attribute">
<h4>Attribute</h4>

<p>An <dfn title="dfn-attribute">attribute</dfn> is a <a>qualified name</a>. 


<p>The PROV data model introduces a pre-defined set of attributes in the <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a>, which we define below. 
The interpretation of any attribute declared in another namespace is out of scope.</p>

<section id="term-attribute-role">
<h4>prov:role</h4>

<p>The attribute <dfn title="dfn-role"><span class="name">prov:role</span></dfn>  denotes the function of an entity with respect to an activity, in the context of a usage, generation,
activity association, activity start, and activity end. The attribute <span class="name">prov:role</span> is allowed to occur multiple times in a list of attribute-value pairs. The value associated with a <span
class="name">prov:role</span> attribute MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value</a>.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following activity start describes the role of the agent identified by <span class="name">ag</span> in this start relation with activity <span class="name">a</span>. </p>
<pre class="codeexample">
   wasStartedBy(a,ag, [prov:role="program-operator"])
</pre>
</div>
</section>

<section id="term-attribute-type">
<h4>prov:type</h4>

<p>The attribute <dfn title="dfn-type"><span class="name">prov:type</span></dfn>  provides further typing information for an element or relation. PROV-DM liberally
defines a type as a category of things having common characteristics. PROV-DM is agnostic about the representation of types, and only states that
the value associated with a <span class="name">prov:type</span> attribute MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value.</a> The attribute <span class="name">prov:type</span>
is allowed to occur multiple times.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following describes an agent of type software agent.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">
   agent(ag, [prov:type="prov:SoftwareAgent" %% xsd:QName])
</pre>
</div>
</section>


<section id="term-attribute-label">
<h4>prov:label</h4>

<p> The attribute <dfn title="dfn-label"><span class="name">prov:label</span></dfn> provides a human-readable representation of a PROV-DM element or relation.  The value associated with the attribute <span class="name">prov:label</span> MUST be a string.</p>

<div class='issue'>
 This is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/track/issues/219">ISSUE-219</a>. </div>

<section id="term-attribute-location">
<h4>prov:location</h4>

<p>A <dfn title="dfn-Location">location</dfn> can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112), but it can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory, row, or column. As such, there are numerous ways in which location can be expressed, such as by a coordinate,
address, landmark, and so forth. This  document does not specify how to concretely express  locations, but instead provide a mechanism to introduce locations, by means of attributes. </p> 


<p>
The attribute <dfn title="dfn-location"><span class="name">prov:location</span></dfn> is an OPTIONAL attribute of entity and activity.  The value associated with the  attribute <span class="name">prov:location</span> MUST be a PROV-DM <a title="value">Value</a>, expected to denote a location.
</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following expression describes entity Mona Lisa, a painting, with a location attribute. </p>

</section>

<section id="term-value">
<h4>Value</h4>

<p>
By means of attribute-value pairs, the PROV data model can refer to <dfn title="value">values</dfn> such as strings, numbers, time, qualified names, and IRIs.  
The interpretation of such values is outside the scope of PROV-DM.</p>
Each kind of such values is called a <em>datatype</em>. Each datatype is identified by an <a>qualified name</a>.</p>

<p>The data types are taken from 
the set of XML Schema Datatypes, version 1.1 [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]] and the RDF specification [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]]. The normative definitions of these datatypes are provided by the respective specifications.

<h2>PROV-DM Extensibility Points</h2>

<ul>
<li> Attributes occur in all elements and relations of the data model.  Applications are free to introduce 
application-specific attributes, according to their perspective on the world.  Attributes for a given application can be distinguished by qualifying them with a prefix denoting a namespace
declared in a namespace declaration.

<p>The <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a> declares a set of reserved attributes catering for extensibility: <span class="name">type</span>, <span
class="name">location</span>.</li>


<li> Sets of Attribute-value pairs offer a mechanism to
describe modalities of use, generation, activity association, and responsibility chain.  
Such attributes are also qualified by namespaces.

<p>To this end, the <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a> declares a reserved attribute: <span class="name">role</span>.</p></li>


<li>Notes allow arbitrary metadata to be associated with anything identifiable in PROV-DM. Notes consist of name-value pairs. Like attributes, names are qualified by a
namespace.</li>


<li>Namespaces allow attributes and names to be qualified. </li>

<li>Sub-typing of elements and relations is allowed by means of the reserved attribute <span class="name">type</span>.</li>

<li>Domain specific values can be expressed by means of typed values. </li>
</ul>

<p>The PROV data model is designed to be application and technology independent, but specializations of PROV-DM are welcome and encouraged.  To ensure interoperability, specializations of
the PROV data model that exploit the extensibility points summarized in this section MUST preserve the semantics specified in the PROV-DM documents (part 1 to 3). </p>

<h4>Data Model Constraints</h4>


<ul>

<li>This specification defines PROV-DM, a data model that allows 
descriptions of the people, institutions, entities, and activities,
involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a
thing to be expressed.  However, with this data model, it is also possible to compose
descriptions that would not make sense: for instance, one could
express that an entity was used before it was generated, or that the
activity that generated an entity began its existence after the entity
generation.  A set of consistency constraints have been defined for PROV-DM and
can be found in a companion specification [[PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS]].
They can be used by asserters as a guideline for composing provenance descriptions that are consistent, and
by implementers of reasoning engines. </li>



<li>
<p> The example of <a href="#prov-dm-example">section 3</a> contains identifiers such as <span class="name"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</a></span>, which denotes a specific version of a technical report.  On the other hand, a URI such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/</a> points to the latest version of a document. One needs to ensure that provenance descriptions for the latter document remain valid as denoted resources change. </p>

<p>To this end, PROV-DM allows asserters to describe "<em>partial states</em>" of entities by means of attributes and associated values. Some further constraints apply to the use of these attributes, since the values associated with them are expected to remain unchanged for some period of time. The constraints associated to attributes are also specified in the companion specification [[PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS]].</p>


</li>


<li>The existence of some mechanism(s)  by which a set of provenance descriptions can be bundled up and named is assumed.  No such mechanism is considered as mature for standardization, and therefore such mechanisms remain outside the scope of PROV-DM.   Various ways of achieving this functionality exist, for instance, by:
<ul>
<li> bundling up a set of descriptions in a file and exposing it as a Web resource;</li>
<li> relying on specific serializations to name bundles of descriptions;</li>
<li> using the idea of a service that is capable of associating provenance descriptions to whom they are attributed to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though a mechanism for blundling up provenance descriptions and naming them is not part of PROV-DM, the idea of a bundle of descriptions is crucial to the PROV approach. Indeed, it allows multiple provenance perspectives to be provided for a given entity. It is also the mechanism by which provenance of provenance can be expressed. Such a named bundle is being referred to as an <dfn>account</dfn> and is regarded as an <a title="concept-accountEntity">AccountEntity</a> so that its provenance can be expressed.   The notion of account is specified in the companion specification [[PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS]], as well as constraint that  <dfn>structurally well-formed</dfn> descriptions are expected to satisfy.</p>
</li>
