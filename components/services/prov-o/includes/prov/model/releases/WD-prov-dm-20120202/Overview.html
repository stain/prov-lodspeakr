    <div id="abstract" class="introductory section"><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
PROV-DM is a data model for provenance for building
representations of the entities, people and activities involved in
producing a piece of data or thing in the world. PROV-DM is
domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing
further domain-specific and application-specific extensions to be
defined.  PROV-DM is accompanied by PROV-ASN, a technology-independent
abstract syntax notation, which allows serializations of PROV-DM
instances to be created for human consumption, which facilitates its
mapping to concrete syntax, and which is used as the basis for a
formal semantics.

<p> 
For the purpose of this specification, <dfn id="dfn-provenance">provenance</dfn> is defined as a record that describes the people,
institutions, entities, and activities, involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world.
In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding
whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its
originators when reusing it.  In an open and inclusive environment
such as the Web, users find information that is often contradictory or
questionable: provenance can help those users to make trust judgments.
</p>


<p>
The idea that a single way of representing and collecting provenance could be adopted internally by all systems does not seem to be realistic today. Instead, a pragmatic approach is to
consider a core data model for provenance that allows  domain and application specific representations of provenance to be translated into such a data model and exchanged between systems.
Heterogeneous systems can then export their provenance into such a core data model, and applications that need to make sense of provenance in heterogeneous systems can then import it,
process it, and reason over it.</p>

<p>Thus, the vision is that different provenance-aware systems natively adopt their own model for representing their provenance, but a core provenance data model can be readily adopted as a
provenance <em>interchange</em> model across such systems.</p>

<p>A set of specifications, referred to as the PROV family of specifications, define the various aspects
that are necessary to achieve this vision in an inter-operable
way, the first of which is this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>PROV-DM: a data model for provenance, accompanied with a notation to express instances of that data model for human consumption (this document); </li>
<li>PROV-O: a normative serialization of PROV-DM in RDF [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-O">PROV-O</a></cite>], specified by means of a mapping to the OWL2 Web Ontology Language [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-OWL2-SYNTAX">OWL2-SYNTAX</a></cite>];</li>
<li>PROV-AQ: the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-AQ">PROV-AQ</a></cite>];</li>
<li>PROV-PRIMER: a primer for the PROV approach [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-PRIMER">PROV-PRIMER</a></cite>];</li>
<li>PROV-SEM: semantics of the PROV-DM data model [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-SEM">PROV-SEM</a></cite>];</li>
</ul>


<p>
The PROV-DM data model for provenance consists of a set of core
concepts, and a few common relations, based on these core concepts.  PROV-DM is a domain-agnotisc model, but with clear extensibility points allowing further domain-specific and
application-specific extensions to be defined.</p>

<p>This specification also introduces
PROV-ASN, an abstract syntax that is primarily aimed at human consumption. PROV-ASN allows
serializations of PROV-DM instances to be written in a technology independent manner,
it facilitates its mapping to concrete syntax, and it is used as the basis for a
formal semantics. This specification uses instances of provenance written in PROV-ASN 
to illustrate the data model.

    <div id="section-entity-activity-agent" class="section"> 
<h4><span class="secno">2.1.1 </span>Entity, Activity, Agent</h4>




<p>This specification is based on a conceptualization of the world
that is described in this section. In the world (whether real or not),
there are things, which can be physical, digital, conceptual, or
otherwise, and activities involving things.  </p>

<p>When we talk about things in the world in natural language and even when we assign identifiers, we are often imprecise in ways that make it difficult to clearly and unambiguously report
provenance: a resource with a URL may be understood as referring to a report available at that URL, the version of the report available there today, the report independent of where it is
hosted over time, etc.</p>

<p>Hence, to accommodate different perspectives on things and their situation in the world as perceived by us, we introduce the idea of a characterized thing, which refers to a thing and its
situation in the world, as characterized by someone. We then define an <dfn id="concept-entity">entity</dfn> as an identifiable characterized thing. An entity <em>fixes some aspects</em> of
a thing and its situation in the world, so that it becomes possible to express its provenance, and what causes these specific aspects to be as such. An alternative entity may fix other
aspects, and its provenance may be different.</p>

<div class="anexample" id="a-report-example">
Different users may take different perspectives on a resource with
a URL. These perspectives in this conceptualization of the world are
referred to as entities. Three such entities may be
expressed:
<ul>
<li>a report available at a URL: fixes the nature of the thing, i.e. a document, and its location; </li>
<li>the version of the report available there today: fixes its version number, contents, and its date;</li>
<li>the report independent of where it is hosted and of its content over time: fixes the nature of the thing as a conceptual artifact.</li></ul>
The provenance of these three entities may differ, and may be along the following lines: 
<ul>
<li>the provenance of a report available at a URL may include: the act of publishing it and making it available at a given location, possibly under some license and access control;</li>
<li>the provenance of the version of the report available there today may include: the authorship of the specific content, and reference to imported content;</li>
<li>the provenance of the report independent of where it is hosted over time may include: the motivation for writing the report, the overall methodology for producing it, and the broad team
involved in it.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We do not assume that any characterization is more important than any other, and in fact, it is possible to describe the processing that occurred for the report to be commissioned, for
individual versions to be created, for those versions to be published at the given URL, etc., each via a different entity that characterizes the report appropriately.</p>

<p>In the world, <dfn id="concept-activity">activities</dfn> involve
entities in multiple ways:  consuming them,  processing them, 
transforming them,  modifying them,  changing them,  relocating
them,  using them,  generating them, being associated with them,
etc.</p>


<p>An <dfn id="concept-agent">agent</dfn> is a type of entity that takes an active role in an activity such that it can be assigned some degree of responsibility for the activity taking
place.
This definition intentionally stays away from using concepts such as enabling, causing, initiating, affecting, etc, because any entities also enable, cause, initiate, and affect in some way
the activities.  So the notion of having some degree of responsibility is really what makes an agent. </p>

<p> Even software agents can be assigned some responsibility for the effects they have in the world, so for example if one is using a Text Editor and one's laptop crashes, then one would say
that the Text Editor was responsible for crashing the laptop.  If one invokes a service to buy a book, that service can be considered responsible for drawing funds from one's bank to make
the purchase (the company that runs the service and the web site would also be responsible, but the point here is that we assign some measure of responsibility to software as well).  So when
someone models software as an agent for an activity in our model, they mean the agent has some responsibility for that activity.
</p>

<p>PROV-DM considers agents as a type of entity so that the model can be
 used to represent the provenance of the agents themselves.  For
 example, a grammarchecker software may be an agent of a document
 preparation activity, but itself can have a provenance record that
 states who its vendor is.</p>


<p> In this specification, the qualifier 'identifiable' is implicit whenever a reference is made to an activity, agent, or an entity.</p>

</div>


    <div id="section-time-event" class="section"> 
<h4><span class="secno">2.1.2 </span>Time and Event</h4>

<p>Time is critical in the context of provenance, since it can help corroborate provenance claims. For instance, if an entity is claimed to be obtained by transforming another, then the
latter must have existed before the former. If it is not the case, then there is something wrong with such a provenance claim. </p>

<p> Although time is critical, we should also recognize that provenance can be used in many different contexts: in a single system, across the Web, or in spatial data management, to name a
few. Hence, it is a design objective of PROV-DM to minimize the assumptions about time, so that PROV-DM can be used in varied contexts.  </p>


<p>Furthermore, consider two activities that started at the same time
instant. Just by referring to that instant, we cannot distinguish
which activity start we refer to. This is particularly relevant if we
try to explain that the start of these activities had different
reasons.  We need to be able to refer to the start of an activity as a
first class concept, so that we can talk about it and about its
relation with respect to other similar starts. </p>


<p>Hence, in our conceptualization of the world, an <em>instantaneous event</em>, or <dfn id="dfn-event">event</dfn> for short, happens in the world and marks a change in the world, in its
activities and in its entities.  
The term "event" is commonly used in process algebra with a similar meaning. For instance, in CSP [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CSP">CSP</a></cite>], events represent communications or interactions; they are assumed to be atomic and
instantaneous.</p>




<div id="types-of-events" class="section">
<h5><span class="secno">2.1.2.1 </span>Types of Events</h5>

<p>Four kinds of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> underpin the PROV-DM data model. The <strong>activity start</strong> and <strong>activity end</strong>  events demarcate the
beginning and the end of activities, respectively. The <strong>entity generation</strong> and <strong>entity usage</strong> events demarcate the characterization interval for entities. More
specifically:

</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-generation-event">entity generation event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the  final instant of an entity's creation timespan, after which
it becomes available for use.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-usage-event">entity usage event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the first instant of an entity's consumption timespan by an activity.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-start-event">activity start event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the instant an activity starts.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-end-event">activity end event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the instant an activity ends.</p>

</div>

<div id="event-ordering" class="section">
<h5><span class="secno">2.1.2.2 </span>Event Ordering</h5>

<p>To allow for minimalistic clock assumptions, like Lamport
[<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CLOCK">CLOCK</a></cite>], PROV-DM relies on a notion of relative ordering of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>,
without using physical clocks. This specification assumes that a partial order exists between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>.
</p>


<p>Specifically, <dfn id="dfn-follows">follows</dfn> is a partial
order between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>, indicating that an <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> occurs at the same time as or after another.
For symmetry, <dfn id="dfn-precedes">precedes</dfn> is defined as
the inverse of follows. (Hence, these relations are reflexive and transitive.)</p>


<p> How such partial order is realized in practice is beyond the scope
of this specification.  This specification only assumes that
each <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> can be mapped to an instant in some form of
timeline. The actual mapping is not in scope of this
specification. Likewise, whether this timeline is formed of a single
global timeline or whether it consists of multiple Lamport's style
clocks is also beyond this specification.  It is anticipated
that <a href="#dfn-follows" class="internalDFN">follows</a> and <a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a> correspond to some ordering
over this timeline.
</p>


<p>This specification introduces a set of "temporal interpretation"
rules allowing the derivation of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> ordering constraints from
provenance records.  According to such temporal interpretation,
provenance records <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> satisfy such constraints.  We note that the
actual verification of such ordering constraints is outside the
scope of this specification. </p>

<p>PROV-DM also allows for time observations to be inserted in specific
provenance records, for each recognized <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> introduced
in this specification.  The presence of a time observation for a
given <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> fixes the mapping of this <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> to the
timeline. It can also help with the verification of associated
ordering constraints (though, again, this verification is outside the
scope of this specification).

<h3><span class="secno">2.2 </span>PROV-ASN: The Provenance Abstract Syntax Notation</h3>

<p>This specification defines PROV-DM, a data model for provenance, consisting of records describing how people, entities, and activities, were involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world.</p>

<p>This specification also relies on a language, PROV-ASN, the Provenance Abstract Syntax Notation, to express
<em>instances</em> of that data model. 
For each construct of PROV-DM, a corresponding ASN expression is introduced, by way of a production in the ASN grammar. </p>





<p>PROV-ASN is an abstract syntax, whose goals are:
</p><ul>
<li>to allow serializations of PROV-DM instances in a technology independent manner, which makes it more readable for human consumption;
</li><li>to facilitate the mapping of PROV-DM to concrete syntax;
</li><li>to provide the basis for a formal semantics.
</li></ul>

<p>This specification provides a grammar for PROV-ASN. Each record of the PROV-DM data model is explained 
in terms of the production of this grammar.</p>



<p>The formal semantics of PROV-DM is defined at
[<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-SEM">PROV-SEM</a></cite>] and its encoding in the OWL2 Web Ontology Language at [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-O">PROV-O</a></cite>].

    <div id="representation-record-assertion-inference" class="section"> 
<h3><span class="secno">2.3 </span>Representation, Record, Assertion, and Inference</h3>

<p>
PROV-DM is a provenance data model designed to express <em>representations</em> of the world.  Such representations are structured according to a set of <em>records</em>.
</p>

<div class="anexample">
A file at some point during its lifecycle, which includes multiple edits by multiple people, can be represented by its location in the file system, a creator, and content.  
</div>


<p>
These records are relative to an asserter, and in that sense constitute assertions stating properties of the world, as represented by an asserter. Different asserters will normally
contribute different records expressive different representations of the world.
This specification does not define a notion of consistency between different sets of records (whether by the same asserter or different asserters).
The data model provides the means to associate attribution to assertions.  
</p>

<div class="anexample">
An alternative representation of the above file is a set of blocks in a hard disk.
</div>


<p>The data model is designed to capture activities that happened in the past, as opposed to activities
that may or will happen. 
However, this distinction is not formally enforced.
Therefore, all PROV-DM records <em class="rfc2119" title="should">should</em> be interpreted as a description of what has happened, as opposed to what may or will happen.</p>



<p> 
This specification does not prescribe the means by which an asserter arrives at records; for example, records can be composed on the basis of observations, reasoning, or any other means. 
</p>


<p>
Sometimes, inferences about the world can be made from records
conformant to the PROV-DM data model. When this is the case, this
specification defines such inferences, allowing new provenance records
to be inferred from existing ones. Hence, representations of the world
can result either from direct assertions of records by asserters or from inference of new records
by application of inference rules defined by this specification.
</p>

    <div id="grammar-notation" class="section"> 
<h3><span class="secno">2.4 </span>Grammar Notation</h3>

The following ER diagram provides a high level overview of the <strong>structure of PROV-DM records</strong>. Examples of provenance assertions that conform to this schema are provided in
the next section.</p>

<div class="figcaption">PROV-DM overview</div>
  
</div>

<div class="note"> Overview diagram does not represent the sub-relations -- proposal to use a UML notation instead of ER.</div>


<p>The model includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <a title="entity record" href="#dfn-entity" class="internalDFN">Entity Record</a> (noted <samp>entity</samp> in the diagram, to reflect the term used in the ASN) is a representation of an <em>entity</em>. 


   </li><li>An <a title="activity record" href="#dfn-activity" class="internalDFN">Activity Record</a>(noted <samp>activity</samp> in the diagram) represents an activity that has an effect on entities, namely it either <em>generates</em>  or <em>uses</em> one or more entities.
  Usage and generation are modelled by means of the <a title="usage record" href="#dfn-Use" class="internalDFN">used</a> and the <a title="generation record" href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">wasGeneratedBy</a> relationships.  Activities may include not only computations, but also any other type of activity that can be described in terms of their effect on <samp>entities</samp>.
Note that multiple <samp>activities</samp> may <em>use</em> the same <samp>entity</samp>, and each activity may use multiple <samp>entities</samp>. Finally, entities can be derived from other entities, and this is specified using the <a title="derivation record" href="#dfn-Derivation" class="internalDFN">wasDerivedFrom</a> relation.</li>

  
  <li>An <a title="agent record" href="#dfn-Agent" class="internalDFN">Agent Record</a> represents a particular <samp>entity</samp> that can be associated to activities, meaning that it can be assigned some degree of
responsibility for an <samp>activity</samp> taking place.
  Agents have a rather generic connotation: their  association with an activity is  represented by the <a title="activity association record" href="#dfn-activity-association" class="internalDFN">wasAssociatedWith</a> relationship, which can
take up various meanings (attribution, responsibility, supervision, management, etc.), which are not individually specified in the model. Relations <a title="start record" href="#dfn-Start" class="internalDFN">wasStartedBy</a>
and <a title="end record" href="#dfn-End" class="internalDFN">wasEndedBy</a> are specializations of <a title="activity association record" href="#dfn-activity-association" class="internalDFN">wasAssociatedWith</a> that can optionally be used to carry additional meaning.
Furthermore, it is recognized that agents can act on behalf of others: hence, the relation <a title="responsibility record" href="#dfn-responsibility" class="internalDFN">actedOnBehalfOf</a> allows for chains of responsibility to be
stated.
</li>



</ul>

<p> A set of attribute-value pairs can be associated to elements and relations of the PROV model in order to further characterize
their nature. 
The       <a title="alternate record" href="#dfn-Alternate" class="internalDFN">alternateOf</a> and  <a title="specialization record" href="#dfn-Specialization" class="internalDFN">specializationOf</a> relationships are used to denote that two <samp>entities</samp> 
represent two alternative characterizations of the same thing, and that one of the two is a more precise characterization than the other, respectively.<br>
The attributes <a title="prov:role" href="#dfn-role" class="internalDFN">role</a> and <a title="prov:type" href="#dfn-type" class="internalDFN">type</a> are pre-defined.  
</p>

<p>
In addition to the kinds of record introduced in the overview figure, PROV-DM also features a notion of <a title="account record" href="#dfn-Account" class="internalDFN">Account Record</a> that allows attribution of provenance
records to be expressed.
</p>


<p>The set of relations presented here forms a core, which is further extended with additional relations, defined in Section <a href="#common-relations">Common Relations</a>.</p>


<p>
The model includes a further additional element: <a title="note record" href="#dfn-note" class="internalDFN">notes</a>. These are also structured as sets of attribute-value pairs.  Notes are used to provide additional,
"free-form" information regarding <em>any</em> identifiable construct of the model, with no prescribed meaning. Notes are described in detail <a href="#record-note">here</a>. 
</p>
   
<p> 
Attributes and notes are the main <em>extensibility points</em> in the model: individual interest groups  are expected to extend PROV-DM by introducing new attributes and notes as needed to
address applications-specific provenance modelling requirements. </p>

<p>
Entity Records (described in <a href="#record-Entity">Section Entity</a>). The file in its various forms and its copies are modelled as entity records, corresponding to multiple
characterizations, as per scenario. The entity records are identified by  <span class="name">e0</span>, ..., <span class="name">e6</span>.</p>
<pre>entity(e0, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice" ])

<p>
Activity Records (described in <a href="#record-Activity">Section Activity</a>) represent activities in the scenario.  Each activity record contains the activity identifier, a start time and
a type attribute characterizing the nature of the activity.</p>

</pre>


<p>
Generation Records (described in <a href="#record-Generation">Section Generation</a>) represent the <a href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">event</a> at which a file is created in a specific form. Attributes are used to
describe the modalities according to which a given entity is generated by a given activity.  The interpretation of attributes is application specific. Illustrations of such attributes for
the scenario are: no attribute is provided for <span class="name">e0</span>;
<span class="name">e2</span> was generated by the editor's  save function;  <span class="name">e4</span> can be found on the smtp port, in the attachment section of the mail message; <span class="name">e6</span> was produced on the standard output of <span class="name">a5</span>. 
Sometimes, it is necessary to refer to generation records in other records. For those cases, we introduce
 identifiers such as <span class="name">g1</span> and <span class="name">g2</span> to  identify the generation records; these identifiers are used in derivations introduced below to
reference those specific records.</p>

<p>
Usage Records (described in <a href="#record-Usage">Section Usage</a>) represent the <a href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">event</a> by which a file is read by an activity. 

Likewise, attributes describe the modalities according to which the various entities are used by activities.  Illustrations of such attributes are:

Sometimes, it is also necessary to refer to usage records in other records. To this end, for these usage records, identifiers such as <span class="name">u1</span> and <span class="name">u2</span> are introduced to identify them; these identifiers are used later in derivations introduced below to refer to these specific Usage records.</p>
<pre>used(a1,e1,[ex:fct="load"])

<p>
Derivation Records (described in <a href="#Derivation-Relation">Section Derivation Relation</a>) express that an entity is derived from another.  The first two are expressed in their compact
version, whereas the following two are expressed in their full version, including the activity underpinning the derivation, and associated  usage (<span class="name">u1</span>, <span class="name">u2</span>) and generation (<span class="name">g1</span>, <span class="name">g2</span>) records.</p>

<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">5. </span>PROV-DM Core</h2>

<p>This section contains the normative specification of PROV-DM core, the core of the PROV data model.</p>

   <div id="PROV-DM-record" class="section"> 
      
<h3><span class="secno">5.1 </span>Record</h3>

<p>This specification introduced <a href="#dfn-provenance" class="internalDFN">provenance</a> as a set of records
describing the people, institutions, entities, and activities,
involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a
thing in the world. PROV-DM is a data model defining the structure and
meaning of such records.</p>


<p>Concretely, PROV-DM consists of a set of constructs to formulate representations of the world and constraints that must be satisfied by them.
A PROV-DN <dfn id="dfn-Record">record</dfn> is a body of information about something which is of interest from a provenance viewpoint.   PROV-DM records may be asserted directly or may be
inferred from others.  
</p>

<p>
PROV-DM records are typed and can be among the following types, introduced one by one in this section:
<a href="#dfn-entity" class="internalDFN">entity record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-activity" class="internalDFN">activity record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Agent" class="internalDFN">agent record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-note" class="internalDFN">note record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Use" class="internalDFN">usage record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Derivation" class="internalDFN">derivation record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-activity-association" class="internalDFN">activity association record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-responsibility" class="internalDFN">responsibility record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Start" class="internalDFN">start record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-End" class="internalDFN">end record</a>,
<a href="#dfn-Alternate" class="internalDFN">alternate record</a>, 
<a href="#dfn-Specialization" class="internalDFN">specialization record</a>, 
<a href="#dfn-annotation" class="internalDFN">annotation record</a>, and
<a href="#dfn-Account" class="internalDFN">account record</a>.
</p>


<p>
Furthermore,  PROV-DM includes a "house-keeping construct", a record container,
 used to wrap PROV-DM records and facilitate their interchange.
Hence, by creating a set of PROV-DM records and packaging them into a record container, 
one forms a provenance record. </p>

<p>In PROV-ASN, such representations of the world <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> be conformant with the toplevel <a href="#dfn-production" class="internalDFN">production</a> <span class="nonterminal">record</span> of the grammar. These <span class="nonterminal">record</span>s are grouped in three categories:
<span class="nonterminal">elementRecord</span> (see section <a href="#record-element">Element</a>),
<span class="nonterminal">relationRecord</span>  (see section <a href="#record-relation">Relation</a>), and
<span class="nonterminal">accountRecord</span> (see section <a href="#record-Account">Account</a>).</p>

<div class="issue">
There is still some confusion about what the identifiers really denote. For instance, are they entity identifiers or entity record identifiers.  This is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/track/issues/183">ISSUE-183</a>.

</div>

   <div id="record-Entity" class="section"> 
      
<h4><span class="secno">5.2.1 </span>Entity Record</h4>

<p>In PROV-DM, an  <dfn id="dfn-entity">entity record</dfn> is a representation of an entity.</p>


<p>Examples of entities include a car on a road, a linked data set, a sparse-matrix matrix of floating-point numbers, a document in a directory, the same document published on the Web,  and
meta-data embedded in a document.</p>

<p>An entity record, noted <span class="name">entity(id, [ attr1=val1, ...])</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em>: an identifier <span class="name">id</span> identifying an entity; </li>
<li><em>attributes</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">[ attr1=val1, ...]</span>, representing this entity's situation in the world.</li>
</ul>


<p>
The assertion of an entity record states, from a given asserter's viewpoint, the existence of an entity, whose situation in the world is represented by the attribute-value pairs, which
remain unchanged during a characterization interval, i.e. a continuous interval between two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> in the world. 
</p>

<p>
In PROV-ASN, an entity record's text matches the <span class="nonterminal">entityRecord</span> production of the grammar defined in this specification document.

<div class="anexample">
<p>
The following entity record,</p>
<pre class="codeexample">entity(e0, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice" ])
</pre>
states the existence of an entity, denoted by identifier <span class="name">e0</span>,  with type <span class="name">File</span> and path <span class="name">/shared/crime.txt</span> in the
file system,  and creator alice The  attributes <span class="name">path</span> and <span class="name">creator</span> are application specific, whereas the attribute <span class="name">type</span> is reserved in the PROV-DM namespace.
</div>

Further considerations:
<ul>
<li>
The entity identifier <span class="name">id</span> contained in an entity record is expected to be unique among all the identifiers contained in  the current account's records. 
This constraint is elaborated upon in <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a>. It means that the current account does not contain any other record for
this identifier. Effectively, <span class="name">id</span>  acts as a <em>local</em> identifier for this record.  In this specification, whenever we write "an entity record identified by ...
",  this identification is to be understood in the context of the account that defines it. </li>
<li>If an asserter wishes to characterize an entity  with the same attribute-value pairs over several intervals, then they are required to create multiple entity records (either by direct
assertion or by inference), each with its own identifier (so as to allow potential dependencies between the various entity records to be expressed).  </li>

<li>There is no assumption that the set of attributes is complete and that the attributes are independent or orthogonal of each other.</li>

<li>A characterization interval may collapse into a single instant.</li>

<li>An entity assertion
 is about a thing, whose  situation in the world may be variant.
 An entity record is asserted at a particular point and is invariant, in the sense that 
its attributes are given a value as part of that assertion.
</li>


<li id="attribute-occurrence-in-entity-record">The attributes
occurring in an entity record <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> be declared in the namespace
referred to by their prefix according to
<a href="#record-attribute">Section record-attribute</a>. Furthermore,
for each attribute, a namespace also declares the number of
occurrences it may have in a list of attributes. An entity record is
valid if the number of occurrences of any of its attributes is
compatible with this attribute's declaration it its namespace. This
property applies to all types of records, and is referred to
as <a href="#dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity" class="internalDFN">attribute occurrence validity</a>.</li>


<li>Activities are not represented by entity records, but instead by activity records, as explained below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, section <a href="#record-ActivityAssociation">Activity Association Record</a>, introduces the idea of <em>plans</em> being associated with activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="name">Plan</span>: entities of type <a href="#dfn-plan" class="internalDFN">plan</a> that represent a set of
actions or steps intended by one or more agents to achieve some goals.</li> 
</ul>





<div class="issue">The characterization interval of an entity record is currently implicit. Making it explicit would allow us to define alternateOf and specializationOf more precisely. 
Beginning and end of characterization interval could be expressed by attributes (similarly to activities). 
How do we define the end of an entity? This is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/track/issues/204">ISSUE-204</a>.

    <div id="record-Activity" class="section"> 
      
<h4><span class="secno">5.2.2 </span>Activity Record</h4>
<p>In PROV-DM, an <dfn id="dfn-activity">activity record</dfn> is a representation of an identifiable activity, which performs a piece of work.</p>


<p>An activity, represented by an activity record, is delimited by its <a title="activity start event" href="#dfn-start-event" class="internalDFN">start</a> and its <a title="activity end event" href="#dfn-end-event" class="internalDFN">end</a> events; hence, it occurs over
an interval delimited by two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>. However, an activity record need not mention time information, nor duration, because they may not be known.</p>

<p>If start and end times are known, they are expressed as <em>attributes</em> of an activity, where the interpretation of attribute in the context of an activity record is the same as the
interpretation of attribute for entity record: an activity record's attribute remains constant for the duration of the activity it represents.  Further characteristics of the activity in the
world can be represented by other attribute-value pairs, which <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> also remain unchanged during the activity duration.</p>

<p>
Examples of activities include driving a car from Boston to Cambridge, assembling a data set based on a set of measurements, performing a statistical analysis over a data set, sorting news
items according to some criteria, running a sparql query over a triple store, editing a file, and publishing a web page. </p>

<p> An activity record, written <span class="name">activity(id, st, et, [ attr1=val1, ...])</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em>: an identifier <span class="name">id</span> identifying an activity;</li>

<li><em>startTime</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> time <span class="name">st</span> indicating the start of the activity;</li>
<li><em>endTime</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> time <span class="name">et</span> indicating the end of the activity;</li>
<li><em>attributes</em>:  an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">[ attr1=val1, ...]</span>, representing other attributes of this activity that hold for its whole

For the interpretation of an activity record, see <a href="#start-precedes-end">start-precedes-end</a>.

this identifier, and that effectively <span class="name">id</span>  acts as a <em>local</em> identifier for this record in the current account.</li>

<li>An activity record is not an entity record.
Indeed, an entity record represents an entity that exists in full at
any point in its characterization interval, persists during this
interval, and preserves the characteristics that makes it
identifiable.  Alternatively, an activity in something that happens,
unfolds or develops through time, but is typically not identifiable by
the characteristics it exhibits at any point during its duration. 
This distinction is similar to the distinction between

<div id="record-Agent" class="section">
<h4><span class="secno">5.2.3 </span>Agent Record</h4>



<p>An <dfn id="dfn-Agent">agent record</dfn> is a representation of an agent, which is an entity that can be assigned some degree of responsibility for an activity taking place.</p>

<p>Many agents can have an association with a given activity.  An agent may do the ordering of the activity, another agent may do its design, another agent may push the button to start it,
another agent may run it, etc.  
As many agents as one wishes to mention can occur in the provenance record, if it is important to indicate that they were associated with the activity. </p>

<p>
From an inter-operability perspective, it is useful to define some basic categories of agents since
it will improve the use of provenance records by applications.  
There should be very few of these basic categories to keep the model simple and accessible. 
There are three types of agents in the model since they are common across most anticipated domain of use:
</p><ul>
<li><span class="name">Person</span>: agents of type Person are people. (This type is equivalent to a "foaf:person" [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-FOAF">FOAF</a></cite>])</li> 
<li><span class="name">Organization</span>: agents of type Organization are social institutions such as companies, societies etc. (This type is equivalent to a "foaf:organization"
[<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-FOAF">FOAF</a></cite>])</li> 
<li><span class="name">SoftwareAgent</span>: a software agent is a piece of software. </li>
</ul>
<p>These types are mutually exclusive, though they do not cover all kinds of agent. </p>


<p>An agent record, noted <span class="name">agent(id, [ attr1=val1, ...])</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>

<p>As provenance records are exchanged between systems, it may be useful to add extra-information about such records. For instance, a "trust service" may add value-judgements about the
trustworthiness of some of the assertions made. Likewise, an interactive visualization component may want to enrich a set of provenance records with information helping reproduce their
visual representation. To help with inter-operability, PROV-DM introduces a simple annotation mechanism allowing any identifiable record to be associated with notes.</p>

<p>A <dfn id="dfn-note">note record</dfn> is a set of attribute-value pairs, whose meaning is application specific. It may or may not be a representation of something in the world.</p>

<p>In PROV-DM, a <dfn id="dfn-Generation">generation record</dfn> is a representation of an instantaneous world <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">event</a>, the completed creation of a new
entity by an activity. This entity become available for usage after this <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous
event</a>. This entity did not exist before creation (though another with a different characterization may have existed before). 
The representation of this <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> encompasses a description of the modalities of generation of this entity by this activity.</p> 

<p>A <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> may be, for example, the completed creation of a file by a program, the completed creation of a linked data set, the completed
publication of a new version of a document, and the complete sending of a value on a communication channel. The point at which creation is actually complete is application specific: 
generation of a file may complete when a lock is released by its creator, whereas actual publication of a document may be after the embargo period that was defined for it.</p>

<p>A generation record, written <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(id,e,a,t,attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em>:  an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> identifier  <span class="name">id</span> identifying the generation record;</li>

 The representation includes a description of the modalities of usage of this entity by this activity.</p>

<p>
A <a title="entity usage event" href="#dfn-usage-event" class="internalDFN">usage event</a> may be a procedure beginning to consume a parameter, a service starting to read a value on a port, a program beginning to read a configuration
file, or the point at which an ingredient, such as eggs, is being added in a baking activity. Usage may entirely consume an entity (e.g. eggs are not longer available after being added to
the mix), or leave it as such, ready for further uses (e.g. a file on a file system can be read indefinitely).</p>

<div id="record-ActivityAssociation" class="section">
<h5><span class="secno">5.3.2.1 </span>Activity Association Record</h5>

<p>The key purpose of agents in PROV-DM is to assign responsibility
for activities.  It is important to reflect that there is a degree in
the responsibility of agents, and that is a major reason for
distinguishing among all the agents that have some association with an
activity and determine which ones are really the originators of the
entity.  For example, a programmer and a researcher could both be
associated with running a workflow, but it may not matter what
programmer clicked the button to start the workflow while it would
matter a lot what researcher told the programmer to do so.  Another
example: a student publishing a web page describing an academic
department could result in both the student and the department being
agents associated with the activity, and it may not matter what
student published a web page but it matters a lot that the department
told the student to put up the web page.  So there is some notion of
responsibility that needs to be captured. </p>

<p>Examples of activity association  include designing, participation, initiation and termination, timetabling or sponsoring. </p>


<p>Provenance reflects activities that have occurred.  In some  
cases, those activities reflect the execution of a plan that was  
designed in advance to guide the execution.  PROV-DM allows attaching  
a plan to an activity record, which represents what was intended to  
happen.  The plan can be useful for various tasks, for example to  
validate the execution as represented in the provenance record, to  
manage expectation failures, or to provide explanations.</p>




<p>In the context of PROV-DM, a <dfn id="dfn-plan">plan</dfn> should be understood as the description of a set of
actions or steps intended by one or more agents to achieve some goal. PROV-DM is not
prescriptive about the nature of plans, their representation, the
actions and steps they consist of, and their intended goals.  Hence,
for the purpose of this specification, a plan can be a workflow for a
scientific experiment, a recipe for a cooking activity, or a list of
instructions for a micro-processor execution.  While PROV-DM does not
specify the representations of plans, it allows for activities to be
associated with plans.  Furthermore, since plans may evolve over time,
it may become necessary to track their provenance, and hence, plans are
entities.  An activity <em class="rfc2119" title="may">may</em> be associated with multiple plans. This
allows for descriptions of activities initially associated with a
plan, which was changed, on the fly, as the activity progresses. Plans
can be successfully executed or they can fail. We expect applications
to exploit PROV-DM <a href="#extensibility-section">extensibility
mechanisms</a> to capture the rich nature of plans and associations
between activities and plans.</p>


<p>Thus, PROV-DM offers two kinds of records. The first, introduced in this section, represents an association between an agent, a plan, and an activity; the second, introduced in <a href="#record-responsibility">Section Responsibility record</a>, represents the fact that an agent was acting on behalf of another, in the context of an activity. </p>


<p>An <dfn id="dfn-activity-association">activity association record</dfn>, written <span class="name">wasAssociatedWith(id,a,ag2,pl,attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, has the following
constituents:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em>:  an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> identifier  <span class="name">id</span> identifying the activity association record;</li> 
<li><em>activity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">a</span> for an activity record;</li>
<li><em>agent</em>: an identifier <span class="name">ag2</span> for an agent record, which represents the agent associated with the activity;</li>
<li><em>plan</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> identifier <span class="name">pl</span> for an entity record, which represents a plan adopted by the agent in the context of this activity;
</li><li><em>attributes</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">attrs</span> that describe the modalities of association of this activity with this agent.</li>

<h5><span class="secno">5.3.3.1 </span>Responsibility Record</h5>

<p>To promote take-up, PROV-DM offers a mild version of responsibility
in the form of a relation to represent when an agent acted on another
agent's behalf.  So in the example of someone running a mail program,
the program is an agent of that activity and the person is also an
agent of the activity, but we would also add that the mail software
agent is running on the person's behalf.  In the other example, the
student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the
department chair, who acts on behalf of the university, and all those
agents are responsible in some way for the activity to take place but
we don't say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what
degree. </p>

<p>We could also say that an agent can act on behalf of several other
agents (a group of agents).  This would also make possible to
indirectly reflect chains of responsibility.  This also indirectly
reflects control without requiring that control is explicitly
indicated.  In some contexts there will be a need to represent
responsibility explicitly, for example to indicate legal
responsibility, and that could be added as an extension to this core
model.  Similarly with control, since in particular contexts there
might be a need to define specific aspects of control that various
agents exert over a given activity.</p>

<h5><span class="secno">5.3.3.2 </span>Derivation Record</h5>

<p>In PROV-DM, a <dfn id="dfn-Derivation">derivation record</dfn> is a representation that some entity is transformed from, created from, or affected by another entity in the world.  </p>


<p>Examples of derivation include the transformation of a canvas into a painting, the transportation of a person from London to New York, the transformation of a relational table into a
linked data set, and the melting of ice into water.</p>


<p>According to <a href="#conceptualization">Section Conceptualization</a>, for an entity to be transformed from, created from, or affected by another in some way, there must be some
underpinning activities performing the necessary actions resulting in such a derivation.  
However, asserters may not assert or have knowledge of these activities and associated details: they may not assert or know their number, they may not assert or know their identity, they may
not assert or know the attributes characterizing how the relevant entities are used or generated. To accommodate the varying circumstances of the various asserters, PROV-DM allows more or
less precise records of derivation to be asserted.  Hence, PROV-DM uses the terms <em>precise</em> and <em>imprecise</em> to characterize the different kinds of derivation record. We note
that the derivation itself is exact (i.e., deterministic, non-probabilistic), but it is its description, expressed in a derivation record, that may be imprecise. </p>

<p>The  lack of precision may come from two sources:</p>
<ul>
<li> the number of activities that underpin a derivation is not asserted or known, or</li>
<li> any of the other details that are involved in the derivation is not asserted or known; these include activity identities, generation and usage records, and their attributes.</li>
</ul>


<!--
Furthermore, assuming that an asserter has full knowledge of an activity underpinning a derivation, the same activity can generally be modelled in terms of sub-activities, composed in a such
a way as to deliver the same behavior. Hence, since activities can be modelled at arbitrary levels of granularity, there is a distinguished case in which a derivation between two entities
<span class="name">e2</span> and <span class="name">e1</span> corresponds <em>exactly</em> to <em>one</em> activity that used <span class="name">e1</span> and generated <span
class="name">e2</span>.    This is to be contrasted to the case where one derivation corresponds to n activities, where n can be any number greater than 1.
Hence, PROV-DM uses the terms <em>one-activity</em> and <em>n-activities</em> to distinguish these two cases.</p>
-->


<p>Hence, we can consider two axis.  An activity number axis that has values  <em>single</em>, <em>multiple</em>,  and <em>unknown</em>, respectively representing the case where one activity
is known to have occurred, more than one activities are known to have occurred, or an unknown number of activities have occurred. Likewise, we can consider another axis to cover other
details (identities, generation and usage records, attributes), with values <em>asserted</em> and <em>not asserted</em>. We can then form a matrix of possible derivations. Out of the six
possibilities, 
PROV-DM offers three forms of derivation derivation records to cater for five othem, while the remaining one is not meaningful.  The following table summarises names for the three kinds of
derivation, which we then explain.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<ul>
<li> The asserter asserts that derivation is due to exactly one activity, and all the details are asserted. We call this a precise-1 derivation record.</li>
<li> The asserter asserts that derivation is due to exactly one activity, but other details,  whether known or unknown, are not asserted. We call this an imprecise-1 derivation record.</li>
<li> The following cases are captured by an imprecise-n derivation record.
<ul>
<li> The asserter knows that multiple activities are involved or ignores the number of activities involved in the derivation, and  other details are not asserted. </li>
<li> The asserter knows that multiple activities are involved in the derivation, and all their details are asserted. In this case,  these activities are connected by means of generated and
used intermediary entities.  Despite all activities and details being known, there is no guarantee that any of these activities plays an active role in the derivation; hence, this case is
also regarded as imprecise. Instead, precise derivations need to be expressed between these intermediary entities.  </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

<p> We note that the last theoretical cases cannot occur, since
  asserting the details of an unknown number of activities is a contradiction.
</p>

<p>In order to represent the number of activities in a derivation, we introduce a PROV-DM attribute <span class="name">steps</span>, which can take two possible values:   <span class="name">single</span> and <span class="name">any</span>.
When <span class="name">prov:steps="single"</span>, derivation is due to one activity; when <span class="name">prov:steps="any"</span>, the number of activities is multiple or not known.</p>


<p>The three kinds of derivation records are successively introduced.  Making use of the attribute <span class="name">steps</span>, we can distinguish the various derivation types.</p>

<p>A <dfn id="dfn-precise-1-derivation-record">precise-1 derivation record</dfn>, written <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(id, e2, e1, a, g2, u1, attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>

<li><em>usedEntity</em>: the identifier <span class="name">e1</span> of  an entity record, which is a representation of the used entity;</li>
<li><em>activity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">a</span> of an activity record, which is a representation of the activity using and generating the above entities;</li>

</ul>
<p>It is <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> to include  the attribute <span class="name">prov:steps</span> in a precise-1 derivation since the record already refers to the one and only one activity underpinning the
derivation.</p>


<p>An <dfn id="dfn-imprecise-1-derivation-record">imprecise-1 derivation record</dfn>, written <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(id, e2,e1, t, attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>

</ul>
<p>An imprecise-1 derivation <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> include the attribute <span class="name">prov:steps</span>,  since it is the only means to distinguish this record from an imprecise-n derivation
record.</p>


<p>An <dfn id="dfn-imprecise-n-derivation-record">imprecise-n derivation record</dfn>, written <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(id, e2, e1, t, attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>

</ul>
<p>It is <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> to include  the attribute <span class="name">prov:steps</span> in an imprecise-n derivation record. It defaults to <span class="name">prov:steps="any"</span>.</p> 


<p>None of the three kinds of derivation is defined to be transitive. Domain-specific specializations of these derivations may be defined in such a way that the transitivity property
holds.</p>


<p>In PROV-ASN, a derivation record's text matches the <span class="nonterminal">derivationRecord</span> production of the grammar defined in this specification document.</p>

<div class="grammar">
<span class="nonterminal">derivationRecord</span>&nbsp;::=

</div>
<p>
The first clause of the alternative, where the activity, generation and usage record identifiers are present formalizes a derivation record is precise-1. The second clause of the alternative, with optional time formalizes imprecise records. The distinction between imprecise-1 and imprecise-n is made by the 
attribute <span class="name">prov:steps</span>.  
</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>The following assertions state the existence of derivations.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">wasDerivedFrom(e5,e3,a4,g2,u2)
wasDerivedFrom(e5,e3,a4,g2,u2,[prov:steps="single"])

wasDerivedFrom(e3,e2,[prov:steps="single"])

wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,[])
wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,[prov:steps="any"])

wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,2012-01-18T16:00:00, [prov:steps="any"])
</pre>
<p>
The first two are precise-1 derivation records expressing that the activity represented by the activity <span class="name">a4</span>, by
using the entity denoted by <span class="name">e3</span> according to usage record <span class="name">u2</span>
 derived the
entity denoted by <span class="name">e5</span> and generated it according to generation record
 <span class="name">g2</span>. 


The third record is an imprecise-1 derivation, which is similar for <span class="name">e3</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, but it leaves the activity record and associated attributes implicit. The fourth and fifth records are imprecise-n derivation records between  <span class="name">e2</span> and  <span class="name">e1</span>, but no information is provided as to the number and identity of activities underpinning the derivation. The six derivation records extends the fifth with the derivation time of <span class="name">e2</span>.
</p>
</div>


<p>An precise-1  derivation record is richer  than an imprecise-1 derivation record, itself, being more informative that an imprecise-n derivation record. Hence, the following implications
hold.</p>
<div class="inference" id="derivation-implications">
Given two entity records denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, <span class="conditional">if</span> the assertion  <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,

<div class="interpretation-forward">

</div>

<!--
<p>
<p>If a derivation record holds for <span class="name">e2</span> and <span class="name">e1</span>, then 
this means that the entity represented by entity record identified by <span class="name">e1</span> has an influence on the entity represented entity record identified by <span
class="name">e2</span>,
  which at the minimum implies temporal ordering, specified as follows.
First, we consider one-activity derivations.</p>

<div class='interpretation' id='derivation-usage-generation-ordering'>Given an activity record identified by <span class="name">a</span>, entity records identified by <span
class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, generation record identified by <span class="name">g2</span>, and usage record identified by <span class="name">u1</span>, <span
class='conditional'>if</span> the record <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,a,g2,u1,attrs)</span>
or <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,[prov:steps="single"] &cup; attrs)</span> holds, <span class='conditional'>then</span>
the following temporal constraint holds:
the <a title="entity usage event">usage</a>
of entity denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> <a>precedes</a> the <a title="entity generation event">generation</a> of
the entity denoted by <span class="name">e2</span>.
</div>

<p>Then, imprecise-n derivations.</p>

<div class='interpretation' id='derivation-generation-generation-ordering'>
Given two entity records denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, <span class='conditional'>if</span> the record <span
class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,[prov:steps="n"] &cup; attrs)</span>
 holds, <span class='conditional'>then</span> the following temporal constraint holds:
the <a title="entity generation event">generation event</a> of the entity denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> <a>precedes</a> the <a title="entity generation event">generation event</a>
of
the entity  denoted by <span class="name">e2</span>.
  </div>

<p>Note that temporal ordering is between generations of <span class="name">e1</span>
and <span class="name">e2</span>, as opposed to precise-1 derivation,
which implies temporal ordering between the usage of <span class="name">e1</span> and
generation of <span class="name">e2</span>.  Indeed, in the case of
imprecise-n derivation, nothing is known about the usage of <span class="name">e1</span>,
since there is no associated activity.</p>

-->


<p>The imprecise-1 derivation has the same meaning as the  precise-1
 derivation, except that an activity  
 is known to exist, though it does not need to be 
asserted.  This is formalized by the following inference rule,
referred to as <em>activity introduction</em>:</p>
<div class="inference" id="activity-introduction">
<span class="conditional">If</span> <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)</span> holds, <span class="conditional">then</span> there exist an activity record identified by <span class="name">a</span>, a usage record identified by <span class="name">u</span>, and a generation record identified by <span class="name">g</span>
such that:
<pre class="codeexample">activity(a,aAttrs)
wasGeneratedBy(g,e2,a,gAttrs)
used(u,a,e1,uAttrs)
</pre>
for sets of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">gAttrs</span>, <span class="name">uAttrs</span>, and <span class="name">aAttrs</span>.
</div>





<p>
Note that inferring derivation from usage and generation does not hold
in general. Indeed, when a generation <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(g, e2, a, attrs2)</span>
<a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a> <span class="name">used(u, a, e1, attrs1)</span>, for
some <span class="name">e1</span>, <span class="name">e2</span>, <span class="name">attrs1</span>, <span class="name">attrs2</span>, and <span class="name">a</span>, one
cannot infer derivation <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2, e1, a, g, u)</span>
or <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)</span> since 
of <span class="name">e2</span> cannot possibly be derived from
 <span class="name">e1</span>, given the creation of <span class="name">e2</span> <a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a> the use
of <span class="name">e1</span>.
</p>


<p>In PROV-DM, the effective placeholder for an entity generation time is the <a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation record</a>. The presence of 
time information in imprecise derivation records is merely a convenience notation for a timeless derivation record and a generation record with this generation time information. </p>

<div class="inference" id="derivation-time-elimination">
<span class="conditional">If</span> <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1,t,attrs)</span> holds, <span class="conditional">then</span> the following records also hold:

<div id="record-alternate-specialization" class="section">

<h5><span class="secno">5.3.3.3 </span>Alternate  and Specialization Records</h5>

<div class="note">This section is currently under revision and in flux</div>

The purpose of the record types defined in this section is to establish a relationship between two entities, which asserts that they provide a different characterization of the same thing. 
Consider for example three entities:
<ul>

  <li><span class="name">e1</span> denoting "Bob, the holder of facebook account ABC",
  
  </li><li><span class="name">e2</span> denoting "Bob, the holder of twitter account XYZ",

  </li><li><span class="name">e3</span> denoting "Bob, the person".
</li></ul>

One may make several assertions to establish that these entities refer to the same the real-world thing Bob, either in different contexts, or at different levels of abstraction. For example:

<ol>
  <li> Entity denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> provides a <em>more concrete</em> characterization of Bob  than <span class="name">e3</span> does;
  </li><li> Entity denoted by <span class="name">e2</span>  provides a <em>more concrete</em> characterization of Bob  than <span class="name">e3</span> does;
  </li><li> The entities denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> and  <span class="name">e2</span> provide two different characterizations of the same thing, i.e., Bob.
</li></ol>

Two relations are introduced to express these assertions:

<ul>

  <li> e2 is a <em>specialization</em> of e1, written <span class="name">specializationOf(e2,e1)</span> captures the intent of assertion (1) and (2);
  </li><li> e2 is an <em>alternative characterization</em> of e1, written <span class="name">alternateOf(e2,e1)</span> captures the intent of assertion (3).
  
  </li></ul>

In order to further convey the intended meaning, the following properties are associated to these two relations.

  <ul>
    <li><span class="name">specializationOf(e2,e1)</span> is <strong>transitive</strong>:    <span class="name">specializationOf(e3,e2)</span> and  <span class="name">specializationOf(e2,e1)</span> implies  <span class="name">specializationOf(e3,e1)</span>.

    </li><li><span class="name">specializationOf(e2,e1)</span> is <strong>anti-symmetric</strong>:   <span class="name">specializationOf(e2,e1)</span> implies that  <span class="name">specializationOf(e1,e2)</span>  does not hold.
    </li><li><span class="name">alternateOf(e2,e1)</span> is <strong>symmetric</strong>:   <span class="name">alternateOf(e2,e1)</span> implies  <span class="name">alternateOf(e1,e2)</span>.
  </li></ul>

  <div class="note">There are proposals to make alternateOf a transitive property. This is still under discussion and the default is for alternateOf <strong>not</strong> to be transitive, and this is what the current text  reflects.</div>

<p>A <dfn id="dfn-Alternate">alternate record</dfn>, written alternateOf(alt1, alt2, attrs) in PROV-ASN, has the following constituents:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>first alternate</em>: an identifier <span class="name">alt1</span> of the first of the two entities</li>
<li><em>second alternate</em>: an identifier <span class="name">alt2</span> of the second of the two entities</li>
<li><em>attrs</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set <span class="name">attrs</span> of attribute-value pairs to further describe this record.</li>
</ul>


<p>A <dfn id="dfn-Specialization">specialization record</dfn> written specializationOf(sub, super, attrs) in PROV-ASN, has the following constituents:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>specialised entity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">sub</span> of the specialised entity</li>
<li><em>general entity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">super</span> of the entity that is being specialised</li>
<li><em>attrs</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set <span class="name">attrs</span> of attribute-value pairs to further describe this record.</li>
</ul>



<p>
An entity record identifier can optionally be accompanied by an account identifier. When this is the case, it becomes possible to use the <span class="name">alternateOf</span> relation to
link two entity record identifiers that are appear in different accounts. (In particular, the entity identifiers in two different account are allowed to be the same.). When account
identifiers are not available, then the linking of entity records through <span class="name">alternateOf</span> can only take place within the scope of a single account.
</p>

<h4>Transitive Derivation Record</h4>


<p>
If <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)</span> holds because attribute <span class="name">a2.1</span> of <span class="name">e2</span> is determined by attribute <span
class="name">a1.1</span> of <span class="name">e1</span>,
and if <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e3,e2)</span> holds because attribute <span class="name">a3.1</span>of <span class="name">e3</span> is determined by  attribute <span
class="name">a2.2</span> of <span class="name">e1</span>, it is not necessarily the case that an attribute of <span class="name">e3</span> is determined by an attribute of <span
class="name">e1</span>; so, an asserter may not be able to assert <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e3,e1)</span>, since it would fail to satisfy constraint <a
href="#derivation-attributes">derivation-attributes</a>.  Hence, the constraint on attributes as expressed in <a href="#derivation-attributes">derivation-attributes</a> invalidates
transitivity in the general case.
</p>

<p>However, there is sense that <span class="name">e3</span> still depends on <span class="name">e1</span>, since <span class="name">e3</span> could not be generated without <span
class="name">e1</span> existing. Hence, we introduce a weaker notion of derivation record, which is transitive.</p>

A transitive derivation record, written <span class="name">dependedOn(e2, e1)</span> in PROV-ASN:
<ul>
<li> contains an identifier <span class="name">e2</span>, denoting an entity record, which represents the entity that is the result of the derivation;
<li> contains an identifier <span class="name">e1</span>, denoting an entity record, which represents the entity that the derivation relies upon.
</ul>
<p>The record <span class="name">dependedOn</span> can only be inferred; in other words, it cannot be asserted. It is
transitive by definition and relies on the previously defined derivation assertions for its
base case.</p>

<h4><span class="secno">5.3.4 </span>Annotation Record</h4>


<p>An <dfn id="dfn-annotation">annotation record</dfn> establishes a link between an identifiable PROV-DM record and a note record referred to by its identifier.  Multiple note records can
be associated with a given PROV-DM record; symmetrically, multiple PROV-DM records can be associated with a given note record.  Since note records have identifiers,  they can also be
annotated. The annotation mechanism (with note record and the annotation record) forms a key aspect of the extensibility mechanism of PROV-DM (see <a href="#extensibility-section">extensibility section</a>).</p> 

<p>An annotation record, written <span class="name">hasAnnotation(r,n,attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, has the following constituents:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>record</em>: an identifier <span class="name">r</span> of the record being annnotated;</li>
<li><em>note</em>: an identifier <span class="name">n</span> of a note record;</li>
<li><em>attributes</em>: an <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em> set <span class="name">attrs</span> of attribute-value pairs to further describe this record.</li>
</ul>


<p>In PROV-ASN, a note record's text matches the <span class="nonterminal">noteRecord</span> production of the grammar defined in this specification document.

It also
asserts an activity, its usage of the first entity, and its generation of the second entity. The <span class="name">usage</span> record is annotated with a style (an application specific way

<p>In this section, two constructs are introduced to group
PROV-DM records.  The first
one, <a href="#dfn-Account" class="internalDFN">account record</a> is itself a

<h4><span class="secno">5.4.1 </span>Account Record</h4>

<p>It is common for multiple provenance records to co-exist. For instance, when emailing
 a file, there could be a provenance record kept by the mail client,
 and another by the mail server. Such provenance records may provide different explanations about something happening in the world, because they are created by different parties or observed
by different witnesses. A given party could also create multiple provenance records about an execution, to capture different levels of details, targeted at different end-users: the
programmer of an experiment may be interested in a detailed log of execution, while the scientists may focus more on the scientific-level description.   Given that multiple provenance
records can co-exist, it is important to know who asserted these records. </p>

<p>In PROV-DM, an <dfn id="dfn-Account">account record</dfn> is a wrapper of records with the following purposes:  </p> 
<ul>
<li> It is the mechanism by which attribution of provenance can be assserted; it allows asserters to bundle up their assertions, and assert suitable attribution;</li>
<li> It provides a scoping mechanism for the uniqueness of identifiers (of elements and relations of PROV-DM);</li>
<li> It provides a scoping mechanism for structural contraints (such as
   <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a> and <a href="#derivation-use">derivation-use</a> discussed in Section <a href="#structural-constraints">structural-constraints</a>).</li>
</ul>



<p>An account record, written <span class="name">account(id, assertIRI, recs, attrs)</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>id</em>: an identifier <span class="name">id</span>  that identifies this account globally;</li>
<li><em>asserter</em>: an IRI, denoted by <span class="name">assertIRI</span>, to identify an asserter; such IRI has no specific interpretation in the context of PROV-DM;</li>

</p>
</div>

<p> An identifier in a record within the scope of an account is intended to denote a single record. However, nothing prevents an asserter from asserting an account containing, for example, 
multiple entity records with a same identifier but different attribute-values. In that case, they should be understood as a single entity record with this identifier and the union of all
attributes values, as formalized in <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a>.</p>

<div class="constraint" id="identifiable-record-in-account">
<p>Given an entity record identifier <span class="name">e</span>,  two sets of attribute-values denoted by <span class="name">av1</span> and <span class="name">av2</span>, 
 two entity records  <span class="name">entity(e,av1)</span> and <span class="name">entity(e,av2)</span> occurring in an account  are equivalent to the entity record <span class="name">entity(e,av)</span> where <span class="name">av</span> is the set of attribute-value pairs formed by the union of <span class="name">av1</span> and <span class="name">av2</span>.</p>

<p>This constraint similarly applies to all other types of records. As a result, the identifier that occurs in a record is unique and acts as a local identifier for that record in that
account.</p>
</div>


<p>Whilst constraint <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a> specifies how to understand multiple entity records with a same identifier within a given account, it does not guarantee that the entity record formed with the union of all attribute-value pairs satisfies the <a href="#dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity" class="internalDFN">attribute occurrence validity</a> property, as illustrated by the following example.</p>


<div class="anexample">
<p>
In the following account record, we find two entity records with a same identifier <span class="name">e</span>.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">account(ex:acc1,
        http://example.org/id,
          entity(e,[prov:type="person", ex:age=20])
          entity(e,[prov:type="person", ex:weight=50, ex:age=30])
          ...)
</pre>

<p>Application of <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a> results in an entity record containing the attribute-value pairs <span class="name">age=20</span>, <span class="name">weight=50</span>, and <span class="name">age=30</span>. The namespace referred to by prefix <span class="name">ex</span> declares the number of occurrences that are permitted for each attribute.  The resulting entity record may or may not satisfy the <a href="#dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity" class="internalDFN">attribute occurrence validity</a>, depending on this namespace. For instance, if the namespace referred to by  <span class="name">ex</span> declares that <span class="name">age</span> must have at most one occurrence, then the resulting entity record does not satisfy the <a href="#dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity" class="internalDFN">attribute occurrence validity</a> property.  This document does not specify how to handle such an entity record.

<p>Account records can be nested since  an account record can occur among the records being wrapped by another account. </p>

An account is said to be well-formed if
it satisfies the constraints  <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a> and <a href="#derivation-use">derivation-use</a>.</p>

<p>Account records constitute a scope for identifier uniqueness. Since accounts can be nested,  scopes can also be nested; thus, the requirement on uniqueness of identifiers should be
understood in the context of such nested scopes.  When a record with an identifier occurs directly within an account, then its identifier denotes this record in the scope of this account,
except in sub-accounts where records with the same identifier occur. </p>

<p>A <dfn id="dfn-RecordContainer">record container</dfn> is a house-keeping construct of PROV-DM, also capable of bundling PROV-DM <a title="record" href="#dfn-Record" class="internalDFN">records</a>. A record container is the
root of a provenance record and can be exploited to package up PROV-DM <a title="record" href="#dfn-Record" class="internalDFN">records</a> in response to a request for the provenance of something ([<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-AQ">PROV-AQ</a></cite>]). Given that a
record container is the root of a provenance record, it is not defined as a PROV-DM record (production <span class="nonterminal">record</span>), since otherwise it could appear arbitrarily
nested inside accounts.</p> 


<p>A record container, written <span class="name">container decls  recs endContainer</span> in PROV-ASN, contains:
</p><ul>
<li><em>namespaceDeclarations</em>: a set <span class="name">decls</span> of namespace declarations, declaring namespaces and associated prefixes, which can be used in <a title="attribute" href="#dfn-attribute" class="internalDFN">attributes</a> and  <a title="identifier" href="#dfn-identifier" class="internalDFN">identifiers</a> occurring inside  <span class="name">recs</span>;</li>
<li><em>records</em>:  a non-empty set of records <span class="name">recs</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the records in <span class="name">recs</span> are implictly wrapped in a default account, scoping all the record identifiers they declare directly, and constituting a toplevel
account, in the hierarchy of accounts.  Consequently, every provenance record is always expressed in the context of an account, either explicitly in an asserted account, or implicitly in a
container's default account.</p>

<p>In PROV-ASN, a record container's text matches the <span class="nonterminal">recordContainer</span> production of the grammar defined in this specification document.</p>

<div id="record-attribute" class="section">
<h4><span class="secno">5.5.1 </span>Attribute</h4>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-attribute">attribute</dfn> is a <em>qualified name</em>. 
An <dfn id="dfn-qualified-name">qualified name</dfn> is a name subject to namespace interpretation. It consists of namespace, denoted by an optional prefix, and a local name. The namespace
is denoted by an IRI [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-IRI">IRI</a></cite>].</p>


<p>PROV-DM stipulates that a qualified name can be mapped into an IRI
 by concatenating the IRI associated with the prefix and the local part (see detailed rule in [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-RDF-SPARQL-QUERY">RDF-SPARQL-QUERY</a></cite>], Section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdf-sparql-query-20080115/#QSynIRI">4.1.1</a>).</p>

<p>A qualified name's prefix is <em class="rfc2119" title="optional">optional</em>. If a prefix occurs in a
 qualified name, it refers to a <a href="#dfn-namespace" class="internalDFN">namespace</a> declared in the
 record container.  In the absence of prefix, the qualified name
 refers to the default namespace declared in the container.</p>

<p>In PROV-ASN, an attribute's text matches the <span class="nonterminal">attribute</span> production of the grammar defined in this specification document.</p>

<div class="note">Note that XML NC_NAME don't allow local identifiers to start with a number.  Instead, should we use the productions used in SPARQL or TURTLE?</div>


<p>
For each attribute in a record, its namespace also declares the number of occurrences it
may have in a list of attributes. The
property <dfn id="dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity">attribute occurrence validity</dfn> holds for a record
if the actual number of occurrences of each attribute in this record is compatible with
this attribute's declaration it its namespace. How to handle records
that do not satisfy the <a href="#dfn-attribute-occurrence-validity" class="internalDFN">attribute occurrence validity</a> property
is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>


<p>From this specification's viewpoint, the interpretation of an attribute declared in a namespace other than prov-dm is out of
scope.</p>

<p>The PROV data model introduces a fixed set of attributes in the <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a>:</p>
<ul>

<p> It is common that we may want to know who or what may have some influence, whether direct or indirect, on a given entity, or who may, directly or not, have some responsibility for a
given outcome.  Hence, we may want to infer such a notion from an existing set of PROV-DM records.   Vice-versa, we may have knowledge of this influence and responsibility, but without
knowing its actual details. Thus, we may also want to assert such a notion. </p>

<p> A <dfn id="dfn-Traceability">traceability record</dfn> states the existence of  a  "dependency path" between two entities, indicating that one entity can be shown to be in the lineage of
another, and may have influenced it, or may bear some responsibility for it, in some way. The traceability relation subsumes derivation, activity association, and responsibility, and is
defined to be transitive.  </p>

<p>The relationship <span class="name">wasInformedBy</span> is not transitive. Indeed, consider the following records.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">wasInformedBy(a2,a1)

<p> We cannot infer <span class="name">wasInformedBy(a3,a1)</span> from them. Indeed,

Likewise, from <span class="name">wasInformedBy(a3,a2)</span>, we know that there exists  <span class="name">e2</span> such that <span class="name">e2</span> was generated by <span class="name">a2</span> and used by <span class="name">a3</span>. The following illustration shows a case for which transitivity cannot hold. The
horizontal axis represents the event line. We see that <span class="name">e1</span> was generated after <span class="name">e2</span> was used. Furthermore, the illustration also shows that
<span class="name">a3</span> completes before <span class="name">a1</span>.  So it is impossible for <span class="name">a3</span> to have used an entity generated by <span class="name">a1</span>.</p>

activity with another activity, also denoted by the name <span class="name">wasStartedBy</span>. Effectively, by considering both record types, the relation <span class="name">wasStartedBy</span> has a range formed by the union of agents and activities.</p>

</div>

The intent of the <em>collection</em> record types relations introduced in this section is to account for <strong>part-of</strong> relationships that may exist amongst entities. Specifically, this section:

<ul>
  <li>introduces a new built-in type <span class="name">collection</span>, and </li>
  <li>introduces relations that let asserters describe how the content of entities of type collection changes over time, as a consequence of insertion and deletion operations.</li>
  </ul>

<p>We adopt a very generic form of collection for the purpose, namely an abstract data types consisting of <strong>set of key-value pairs</strong>, often referred to as a <strong>map</strong>. This provides a generic indexing structure that can be used to model commonly used data structures, including associative lists (also known as "dictionaries" or maps in some programming languages), relational tables, ordered lists, and more (the specification of such specialized structures in terms of key-value pairs is out of the scope of this document).</p>

<p>Keys and values used in collections are literals. This allows expressing nested collections, that is, collections whose values include entities of type collection.</p>

<p>The following relations and corresponding record types are introduced to model (a) insertion of a new key-value pair into a collection and (b) removal of a key-value pair from a collection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Record:  <span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c2,c1, k, v)</span> denotes that collection  <span class="name">c2</span> represents the new state of collection <span class="name">c1</span>,
following the insertion of pair <span class="name">(k,v)</span> into  <span class="name">c1</span></li>

<li>  Record: <span class="name">CollectionAfterRemoval(c2,c1, k)</span> denotes that collection  <span class="name">c2</span> represents the removal of pair <span class="name">(k,v)</span> from  <span class="name">c1</span>, where  <span class="name">v</span> is the value
corresponding to key  <span class="name">k</span> in  <span class="name">c1</span>. </li>

</ul>

<p>
Because these relations state the derivation of a collection from another, formally they are specializations of the precise-1  <a href="#Derivation-Relation"><strong>wasDerivedFrom</strong></a> relation.</p>

The following entity types are introduced:

<ul>
  <li> <span class="name">prov:type="Collection"%%xsd:QName</span>  denotes that the entity is a collection, that is, it can participate in  <span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion</span> and  <span class="name">CollectionAfterDeletion</span> relations;

  </li><li><span class="name">prov:type="emptyCollection"%%xsd:QName</span> denotes that the entity is a collection, and furthermore that it does not contain any key-value pairs.
</li></ul>

<div class="note">Given the specific nature of the derivation, the intervening activity that accounts for imprecise-1 derivation should have an equally specific type, such as"
collection-insertion" and "collection-rmoval". This is left for a future version.</div>

<p>The intent of these relations and entity types is to capture the <em>history of changes that occurred to a collection</em>. </p>

<p>The following examples illustrate how these assertions are expected to be used in practice.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">   entity(c, [prov:type="EmptyCollection"])    // e is an empty collection
   entity(k1)
   entity(v1)
   entity(k2)
   entity(v2)
   entity(c1, [prov:type="Collection"])
   entity(c2, [prov:type="Collection"])
  
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 = { (k1,v1) }
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c1, k2, v2)      // c2 = { (k1,v1), (k2 v2) }
  CollectionAfterRemoval(c3, c2, k1)            // c3 = { (k2,v2) }
</pre>
</div>

<p>This representation of a collection's evolution makes no assumption regarding the underlying data structure used to store and manage collections. In particular, no assumptions are needed regarding the mutability of a data structure that is subject to updates.   In fact, the state of a collection (i.e., the set of key-value pairs it contains) at a given point in a sequence of operations is never stated explicitly. Rather, it can be obtained by querying the chain of derivation assertions involving insertions and removals. Entity type <span class="name">prov:type="emptyCollection"</span> can be used in this context as it marks the start of a sequence of collection operations.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>

  <li> One can have multiple assertions regarding the state of a collection following a <em>set</em> of insertions, for example:<br>
<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c2,c1, k1, v1)</span><br>
<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c2,c1, k2, v2)</span><br>
  <span class="name">...</span><br>
This is interpreted as <em>" <span class="name">c2</span> is the state that results from inserting  <span class="name">(k1, v1)</span>,  <span class="name">(k2, v2)</span> etc. into  <span class="name">c1</span></em></li>
  
<li> It is possible to have multiple derivations from a single root collection, possibly by different asserters, as shown in the following example.

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="EmptyCollection"])    // e is an empty collection
  entity(k1)
  entity(v1)
  entity(k2)
  entity(v2)
  entity(k3)
  entity(v3)
  entity(c1, [prov:type="Collection"])
  entity(c2, [prov:type="Collection"])
  entity(c3, [prov:type="Collection"])
  
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 = { (k1,v1) }
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c, k2, v2)       // c2 = { (k2 v2) }
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c3, c1, k3,v3)       // c3 = { (k1,v1),  (k3,v3) }
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>Both relations are functional, in the sense that they represent a state change following a unique insertion/removal operation (or a unique set of them). Thus, from the pair of assertions:

<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c, c1, k1, v1)</span><br>
<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c, c2, k2, v2)</span><br>

one can infer: <span class="name">c1==c2, k1==k2, v1==v2</span>, because one cannot have two different derivations for the same final collection state.</li>

<li>The following set of insertions:<br>

<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k, v1)</span><br>
<span class="name">CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k, v2)</span><br>

entails  <span class="name">v1==v2</span>.</li>


<li> The state of a collection is only known to the extent that a chain of derivations starting from an empty collection can be found. It is understood that a set of assertions regarding a collection's evolution may be incomplete, and therefore so is the reconstructed state obtained by querying those assertions. In general, all assertions reflect the asserter's partial knowledge of a sequence of data transformation events. In the particular case of collection evolution, in which the asserter  <em>knows</em> that some of the state changes may have been missed, then the more generic <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom</span> relation should be used to signal that some updates may have occurred, which cannot be precisely asserted as insertions or removals. The following two examples illustrate this.

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="collection"])    // e is a collection, possibly not empty
  entity(k1)
  entity(v1)
  entity(k2)
  entity(v2, [prov:type="collection"])    // v2 is a collection

  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 <em>includes</em> { (k1,v1) } but may contain additional unknown pairs
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c1, k2, v2)      // c2 includes { (k1,v1), (k2 v2) } where v2 is a collection with unknown state
</pre>
</div>
  In the example, the state of <span class="name">c2</span> is only partially known because the collection is constructed from partially known other collections.

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="emptyCollection"])    // e is an empty collection
  entity(k1)
  entity(v1)
  entity(k2)
  entity(v2)

  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 = { (k1,v1) }
  wasDerivedFrom(c2, c1)                        // the asserted knows that c2 is somehow derived from c1, but cannot assert the precise sequence of updates
    CollectionAfterInsertion(c3, c2, k2, v2)       
</pre>
</div>
Here  <span class="name">c3</span> includes <span class="name">{ (k2 v2) }</span> but the earlier "gap" leaves uncertainty regarding  <span class="name">(k1,v1)</span>  (it may have been removed) or any other pair that may have been added as part of the derivation activities.

</li></ul>

<p> An assertion CollectionAfterInsertion, written <span class="name"> CollectionAfterInsertion(collAfter, collBefore, key, value)</span>, contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>entity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">collAfter</span> for the collection record representing the collection <em>after</em> the insertion; </li>
<li><em>source</em>: an identifier <span class="name">collBefore</span>  for the collection record representing the collection <em>before</em> the insertion;</li>
<li><em>source</em>: an identifier <span class="name">key</span>  for the key that has been inserted into <span class="name">collBefore</span></li>
<li><em>source</em>: an identifier <span class="name">value</span>  for the value corresponding to the key that has been inserted into <span class="name">collBefore</span></li>
</ul>

<p> An assertion CollectionAfterDeletion, written <span class="name"> CollectionAfterDeletion(collAfter, collBefore, key)</span>, contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>entity</em>: an identifier <span class="name">collAfter</span> for the collection record representing the collection <em>after</em> the deletion; </li>
<li><em>source</em>: an identifier <span class="name">collBefore</span>  for the collection record representing the collection <em>before</em> the deletion;</li>
<li><em>source</em>: an identifier <span class="name">key</span>  for the key corresponding to the (key, value) pair that has been deleted from <span class="name">collBefore</span></li>

(and its inverse <a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a>) between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>.  Furthermore,
PROV-DM assumes the existence of a mapping from <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> to time clocks,
though the actual mapping is not in scope of this specification.</p>

<p>Given that provenance records offer a description of past entities
and activities, to be meaningful provenance records <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em>
satisfy <em>instantaneous event ordering constraints</em>, which we introduce in
this section.  For instance, an entity can only be used after it was
generated; hence, we say that an entity's <a title="entity generation
event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> precedes any of this
entity's <a title="entity usage event" href="#dfn-usage-event" class="internalDFN">usage event</a>.  Should this
ordering constraint be proven invalid, the associated generation and
usage records could not be credible.  The rest of this section defines
the <dfn id="dfn-temporal-interpretation">temporal interpretation</dfn> of provenance records as the
set of instantaneous event ordering constraints associated with provenance
records.  </p>


<p>PROV-DM also allows for time observations to be inserted in
specific provenance records, for each of the four kinds
of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> introduced in this specification.  The
presence of a time observation for a given <a>instantaneous event</a> fixes the
mapping of this <a>instantaneous event</a> to the timeline. The presence of time
information in a provenance record instantiates the ordering constraint with
that time information. It is expected that such instantiated
constraint can help corroborate provenance information. We anticipate
that verification algorithms could be developed though this
verification is outside the scope of this specification.
</p>

<p>The following figure summarizes the ordering constraints in a
graphical manner. For each subfigure, an event time line points to the
right. Activities are represented by rectangles, whereas entities are
represented by circles. Usage, generation and derivation records are
represented by the corresponding edges between entities and
activities.  The four kind of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> are represented by vertical
dotted lines (adjacent to the vertical sides of an activity's
rectangle, or intersecting usage and generation edges).  The ordering
constraints are represented by triangles: an occurrence of a triangle between two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> vertical dotted lines represents that the event denoted by the left
line precedes the event denoted by the right line.</p>

<h3><span class="secno">7.2 </span>PROV-DM Structural Constraints</h3>



<p>Sections 5 and 6 define a data model for provenance, which, for the most part, is unconstrained. Section 7.1 defines an interpretation of this data model, in terms of event ordering
constraints.  This section introduces further constraints on the structure of PROV-DM records.  Records that satisfy these constraints are said to be <dfn id="dfn-structurally-well-formed">structurally well-formed</dfn>.  A
benefit of structurally well-formed provenance records is that further inferences can be made, because records are more precise, and therefore, richer. </p>

<p>According to the definition of a <a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation record</a>, an entity becomes available after this entity's generation event, and does not exist before this event.  From this definition,
we conclude that PROV-DM does not allow for an entity to have two generation records occurring at two different instants.
The rationale for this constraint is as follows.
 Two distinct <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation events</a> (by a same activity or by two distinct activities), occurring one after the other, necessarily create two distinct
entities; otherwise, the second <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> would have resulted in an entity that existed before its creation, which contradicts the definition of
<a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation record</a>.</p>

<p>So, PROV-DM allows for two distinct <a>generation records</a>  <span class="name">g1</span> and <span class="name">g2</span> referencing a same entity record provided they occur
<em>simultaneously</em>. 
<!-- (This means that <span class="name">g1</span> <a>precedes</a> <span class="name">g2</span> and <span class="name">g2</span> <a>precedes</a> <span class="name">g1</span>.) -->
  In practice, for such a simultaneous generation to occur, the generation event has to be unique and caused by a <em>single world activity</em>, though the provenance records may contain
different activity records providing alternative descriptions of that same world activity. 
</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>
In the following assertions, a workflow execution  <span class="name">a0</span> consists of two sub-workflow executions  <span class="name">a1</span> and <span class="name">a2</span>.
Sub-workflow execution <span class="name">a2</span> generates entity <span class="name">e</span>, so does <span class="name">a0</span>.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">activity(a0,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
activity(a1,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
activity(a2,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
wasInformedBy(a2,a1)

wasGeneratedBy(e,a0)
wasGeneratedBy(e,a2)
</pre>
This example is permitted in PROV-DM if the two activity records <span class="name">a0</span> and <span class="name">a2</span> provide alternate descriptions of what happens in the world
with respect to this generation event.
</div>

<p>While this example is permitted in PROV-DM, it does not expose the hierarchical organization of executions and  it mixes records providing two descriptions of a same execution. This issue
is highlighted by two different <a title="generation record" href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation records</a> for entity <span class="name">e</span>, which makes reasoning about this kind of provenance records
unnecessarily difficult.  Such assertions are said not be structurally well-formed.</p>

<p>Structurally well-formed provenance records can be obtained by partitioning the generation records into different accounts. This makes it clear that these records provide alternative
descriptions of the same real-world generation event, rather than describing two generation events for the same entity. When accounts are used, the example can be encoded as follows.</p>


<div class="anexample">
<p>
The same example is now revisited, with the following assertions that are structurally well-formed. Two accounts are introduced, and there is a single generation record for entity <span class="name">e</span> per account.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">account(ex:summary,
        http://example.org/asserter, 
        activity(a0,t1,t2,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        wasGeneratedBy(e,a0))

account(ex:detailed,
        http://example.org/asserter, 
        activity(a1,t1,t3,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        activity(a2,t3,t2,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        wasInformedBy(a2,a1)
        wasGeneratedBy(e,a2))
</pre>
</div>



<!--
<p>A given entity record can be referred to in a single generation record in the scope of a given <a href="#record-Account">account</a>.
The rationale for this constraint is as follows.
If two activities sequentially set different values to some attribute by means of two different <a title="entity generation event">generation events</a>, then they generate distinct
entities. Alternatively,  for two activities to generate an entity simultaneously, they would require some synchronization by which they agree the entity is released for use; the end of this
synchronization would constitute the actual generation of the entity, but is performed by a single activity. This uniqueness constraint is formalized as follows.
-->


<p>Structurally well-formed records satisfy some constraints, which force the structure of descriptions to be exposed by means of accounts. With these constraints satisfied, further
inferences can be made about structurally well-formed records.
The uniqueness of generation records in accounts is formulated as follows.
</p>

<div class="constraint" id="generation-uniqueness">Given an entity record denoted by <span class="name">e</span>, two activity records denoted by <span class="name">a1</span> and <span class="name">a2</span>, and two sets of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">attrs1</span> and <span class="name">attrs2</span>,
<span class="conditional">if</span> the records <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e,a1,attrs1)</span> and <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e,a2,attrs2)</span> exist in the scope of a given
account,
<span class="conditional">then</span> <span class="name">a1</span>=<span class="name">a2</span>  and <span class="name">attrs1</span>=<span class="name">attrs2</span>.
</div> 



<p>A further inference is permitted from the imprecise-1 derivation record: </p>
<div class="inference" id="derivation-use">
<p>Given an activity record identified by <span class="name">a</span>, entity records identified by <span class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, and set of attribute-value
pairs <span class="name">attrs2</span>,
<span class="conditional">if</span> <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1, [prov:steps="single"])</span> and <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e2,a,attrs2)</span> hold, <span class="conditional">then</span> <span class="name">used(a,e1,attrs1)</span> also holds
for some set of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">attrs1</span>.
</p></div>
<p>This inference is justified by the fact that the entity represented by entity record identified by <span class="name">e2</span> is generated by at most one activity in a given account
(see <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a>). Hence,  this activity record is also the one referred to in the usage record of <span class="name">e1</span>. 
</p>



<p>We note that the converse inference, does not hold.
From <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)</span> and <span class="name">used(a,e1)</span>, one cannot
derive <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e2,a,attrs2)</span> because identifier <span class="name">e1</span> may occur in usage records referring to 
many activity records, but they may not be referred to in generation records containing identifier <span class="name">e2</span>.</p>


<p>
An account is said to be structurally well-formed if
it satisfies the constraint  <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a>. If an account is structurally well-formed, it support the inference <a href="#derivation-use">derivation-use</a>.</p>

<p> The union of two accounts is another account, 
containing the unions of their respective records, where
 records with a same identifier should be understood according to constraint <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a>. Structurally well-formed
accounts are not
closed under union because the
constraint <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a> may no
longer be satisfied in the resulting union.  </p>

<p>
Indeed, let us reconsider example <a href="#account-example-1">account-example-1</a>, and let us define another account record as follows.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">account(ex:acc2,
        http://example.org/asserter2,

          ...
          activity(a1,t1,,[prov:type="createFile"])
          ...
          wasGeneratedBy(e0,a1,[ex:fct="create"])

If accounts <span class="name">ex:acc0</span> and <span class="name">ex:acc2</span> are merged together,

<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">8. </span>PROV-DM Extensibility Points</h2>


<p>The PROV data model provides several extensibility points that allow designers to specialize it to specific applications or domains. We summarize these extensibility points here:

</p><ul>
<li> Attributes are constructs of the data model that allow representations of aspects of the world's entities and activities to be expressed.  Applications are free to introduce
application-specific attributes, according to their perspective on the world.  Attributes for a given application can be distinguished by qualifying them with a prefix denoting a namespace
declared in a namespace declaration.

<p>The <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a> declares a set of reserved attributes catering for extensibility: <span class="name">type</span>, <span class="name">location</span>.</p></li>


<li> Sets of Attribute-value pairs offer a mechanism to
describe modalities of use, generation, and control  
Such attributes are also qualified by namespaces.

<p>To this end, the <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a> declares a reserved attribute: <span class="name">role</span>.</p></li>


<li>Note records allow arbitrary metadata to be associated with identifiable records of PROV-DM. Note records consist of name-value pairs. Like attributes, names are qualified by a
namespace.</li>


<li>Namespaces allow attributes and names to be qualified. </li>

<li>Subtyping of elements and relations is allowed by means of the reserved attribute <span class="name">type</span>.</li>

<li>Domain specific values can be expressed by means of typed literals. </li>
</ul>

<p>The PROV data model is designed to be application and technology independent, but specializations of PROV-DM are welcome and encouraged.  To ensure inter-operability, specializations of
the PROV data model that exploit the extensibility points summarized in this section <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> preserve the semantics specified in this document. For instance, a qualified attribute on a domain
specific entity record <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> represent an aspect of an entity and this aspect <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> remain unchanged during the characterization's interval of this entity record.</p>



    </div> 



<div id="resource-section" class="section">
<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">9. </span>Resources, URIs, Entities, Identifiers, and Scope</h2> 

<p>This specification  introduces the  notion of an identifiable entity in the world. In PROV-DM, an entity record is a representation of such an identifiable entity. An entity record
includes an identifier identifying this entity.  Identifiers are qualified names, which can be mapped to IRIs.  </p>

<p>The term 'resource' is used in a general sense
      for whatever might be identified by a URI [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-RFC3986">RFC3986</a></cite>].  On the Web, a URI denotes a resource, without any expectation that the resource is accessed. </p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to clarify the relationship between resource and the notions of entity and  entity record. </p>  

<p>In the context of PROV-DM, a resource is just a thing in the world. One may take multiple perspectives on such a thing and its situation in the world, fixing some its aspects.</p>

<p> We refer to the <a href="#a-report-example">example</a> of section <a href="#conceptualization">2.1</a> for a resource (at some URL) and three different perspectives, referred to as
entities.  Three different entity records can be expressed for this report, which in the PROV-ASN sample below, are expressed within a same account.
</p>

<pre>container
prefix app http://example.org/app/
prefix cr  http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc1,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:0, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           entity(app:1, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])
           entity(app:2, [ prov:type="Document", cr:author="John" ])
        ...)
endContainer
</pre>

<p>Each entity record contains an identifier that is unique in
account <span class="name">acc1</span>, and therefore locally
identifies the entity record it is contained in.  In this example,
three identifiers were minted.</p>

<p>Given that the report is a resource denoted by the URI <span class="name">http://example.org/crime.txt</span>, we could simply use this URI as the identifier of an entity. This would
avoid us minting new URIs.  Hence, the report URI would play a double role: as a URI it denotes a resource accessible at that URI, and as an identifier in a PROV-DM record, it helps identify
a specific characterization of this report. A given identifier occurring in an entity record must be unique within the scope of an account. Hence, below, all entities records have been given
the same identifier but appear in the scope of different accounts, so as to satisfy  <a href="#identifiable-record-in-account">identifiable-record-in-account</a>.</p>

<pre>container 
prefix app http://example.org/
prefix cr  http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc2,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           ...)

   account(acc3,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])
           ...)

   account(acc4,
           http://example.org/asserter1,
           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:author="John" ])
           ...)
endContainer
</pre>

<p>In this case, the qualified name  <span class="name">app:crime.txt</span> maps to URI <span class="name">http://example.org/crime.txt</span> still denotes the same resource; however, the
perspectives we take about that resource are expressed by multiple entity records, happening to all contain the same identifier but in different accounts. </p>

<p> Alternatively, if we need to assert the existence of two different perspectives on the report within the same account, then alternate identifiers <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> be used, one of them being allowed
to be the resource URI.</p>

<pre>container 
 prefix app  http://example.org/
 prefix app2 http://example.org/app/
 prefix cr   http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc5,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           entity(app2:1, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])

           ...)
endContainer

</pre>
