This example describes the provenance of the prov-dm (version 2)
document http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215

We can envisage three different accounts at least.

1. Account 1: the W3C view
This account contains the kind of provenance records that
W3C could keep, for auditors to check that due processes are followed.

In this account, we see that:
- WD-prov-dm-20111215 was derived from WD-prov-dm-20111018
- both WD-prov-dm-20111215 and WD-prov-dm-20111018 were published by the w3c agent
- the publication activity for WD-prov-dm-20111215 used a publication request (req3)
- the publication activity for WD-prov-dm-20111018 used another publication request (req2)
  and a transition request (req1)
- publications were according to the process rules (a plan).

A simple visualization of Account 1 may be as follows.
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication1.pdf


2. Account 2: the Web master view
This account contains the kind of provenance records that the webmaster
could keep.

In this account, we see that
- WD-prov-dm-20111215 was derived from Overview.html in the mercurial repo
- WD-prov-dm-20111215 is the result of copying file(s) to the remote web server
- webmaster was involved
- webmaster did all this on the basis of the publication request (req3)

A simple visualization of this account may be as follows.
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication2.pdf


3. Account 3: the authors view.  
 That's what each author could keep (for instance, to write in their CV).
- the document WD-prov-dm-20111215 was co-edited by a set of authors, with various roles

Again, visualization could as follows.
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication3.pdf

4. We can envisage other accounts.
- The mercurial log with all edits.
- An account where other agents claim contribution to the document (faithfully or not)
- etc



To illustrate this example, I have written the three accounts in three separate asn files:

http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication1.prov-asn
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication2.prov-asn
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/examples/w3cpub/w3c-publication3.prov-asn



In this example, each WD is identified by its URI
http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111215
http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018



The entity records in the different accounts have different attributes
and different values. (Similarly to example of section 9 in the prov-dm document.)

In account 1, the type that matters for the W3C process is that it is a Working Draft.
entity(w3:WD-prov-dm-20111215, [ prov:type="WD" ])

In account 2, the type that matters for the W3C master is that it is an html4 document.
entity(w3:WD-prov-dm-20111215, [ prov:type="html4" ])
Other attributes that may usefully captured include that the document
was check to complian with pubrules, it is html4 compliant, etc

In account 3, the authors know this the second version of the prov-dm report.
Hence, the entity record has the following shape.
entity(w3:WD-prov-dm-20111215, [ prov:type="document", ex:version="2" ])

When in account 1, we write
wasGeneratedBy(w3:WD-prov-dm-20111215, ex:pub2)
we really mean to refer to the record of WD-prov-dm-20111215 in the same account,
it would not make sense to say ex:pub2 generated WD-prov-dm-20111215 in account 3.

In Account 2, there is a further example that uses record identifiers. In this
derivation, we need to identify the generation and usage.
wasDerivedFrom(w3:WD-prov-dm-20111215,hg:Overview.html, ex:rcp, rec:g, rec:u)
