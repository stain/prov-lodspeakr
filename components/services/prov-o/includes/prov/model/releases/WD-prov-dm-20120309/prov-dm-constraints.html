    <div id="abstract" class="introductory section"><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
PROV-DM is a data model for provenance that describes
the entities, people and activities involved in
producing a piece of data or thing in the world. PROV-DM is
domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing
further domain-specific and application-specific extensions to be
defined.  PROV-DM is accompanied by PROV-N, a technology-independent
notation, which allows serializations of PROV-DM
instances to be created for human consumption, which facilitates the
mapping of PROV-DM to concrete syntax, and which is used as the basis for a
formal semantics of PROV-DM.  This document introduces
 further set of concepts underpinning the PROV-DM data model and defines constraints that well-structured provenance descriptions should follow and that provide an interpretation for these descriptions.

This document is part of the PROV family of specifications, a set of specifications aiming to define the various aspects that are necessary to achieve the vision of inter-operable
interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.   This document defines  the PROV-DM data model for provenance, accompanied with a notation to express
instances of that data model for human consumption. Other documents are:

<p> Provenance is defined as a record that describes the people,
institutions, entities, and activities, involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world.  A
companion specification [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>] defines PROV-DM, a data model for
provenance, allowing such descriptions to be expressed.  
</p>


<p>PROV-DM has essentially be defined without any constraints  [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>]. This document introduces a further set of concepts underpinning this data model and defines constraints that well-structured provenance descriptions should follow and that provide an interpretation for these descriptions. </p>


<p>This specification is one of several specifications, referred to as the PROV family of specifications, defining the various aspects
that are necessary to achieve the vision of  inter-operable exchange of provenance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data model for provenance, which is presented in three documents:
<ul>
<li> PROV-DM (part I): the provenance data model itself, expressed in natural language  [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>];
</li><li> PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS (part II): constraints underpinning the data model (this document);
</li><li> PROV-N (part III): a notation to express instances of that data model for human consumption [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-N">PROV-N</a></cite>];
</li></ul> 
</li>

<li>PROV-O: a normative serialization of PROV-DM in RDF [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-O">PROV-O</a></cite>], specified by means of a mapping to the OWL2 Web Ontology Language [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-OWL2-SYNTAX">OWL2-SYNTAX</a></cite>];</li>
<li>PROV-AQ: the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-AQ">PROV-AQ</a></cite>];</li>
<li>PROV-PRIMER: a primer for the PROV approach [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-PRIMER">PROV-PRIMER</a></cite>];</li>

<div id="prov-dm-refinement" class="section">
<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Data Model Refinement</h2>

<p>Underpinning the PROV-DM data model is a notion of event, marking transitions in the world (when entities are generated, used, or destroyed, or activities started or ended).  This notion of event is not first-class in the data model, but underpins many of its concepts and its semantics [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-SEM">PROV-SEM</a></cite>].  Thus, using this notion of event, we can provide an interpretation for the data model, which in turn can allow creators of provenance assertions to make their assertions more robust. </p>


    <div id="section-time-event" class="section"> 
<h3><span class="secno">2.1 </span>Time and Event</h3>

<p>Time is critical in the context of provenance, since it can help corroborate provenance claims. For instance, if an entity is claimed to be obtained by transforming another, then the
latter must have existed before the former. If it is not the case, then there is something wrong with such a provenance claim. </p>

<p> Although time is critical, we should also recognize that provenance can be used in many different contexts: in a single system, across the Web, or in spatial data management, to name a
few. Hence, it is a design objective of PROV-DM to minimize the assumptions about time, so that PROV-DM can be used in varied contexts.  </p>


<p>Furthermore, consider two activities that started at the same time
instant. Just by referring to that instant, we cannot distinguish
which activity start we refer to. This is particularly relevant if we
try to explain that the start of these activities had different
reasons.  We need to be able to refer to the start of an activity as a
first class concept, so that we can talk about it and about its
relation with respect to other similar starts. </p>


<p>Hence, in our conceptualization of the world, an <em>instantaneous event</em>, or <dfn id="dfn-event">event</dfn> for short, happens in the world and marks a change in the world, in its
activities and in its entities.  
The term "event" is commonly used in process algebra with a similar meaning. For instance, in CSP [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CSP">CSP</a></cite>], events represent communications or interactions; they are assumed to be atomic and
instantaneous.</p>




<div id="types-of-events" class="section">
<h4><span class="secno">2.1.1 </span>Types of Events</h4>

<p>Four kinds of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> underpin the PROV-DM data model. The <strong>activity start</strong> and <strong>activity end</strong>  events demarcate the
beginning and the end of activities, respectively. The <strong>entity generation</strong> and <strong>entity usage</strong> events demarcate the characterization interval for entities. More
specifically:

</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-generation-event">entity generation event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the  final instant of an entity's creation timespan, after which
it is no longer available for use.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-usage-event">entity usage event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the first instant of an entity's consumption timespan by an activity.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-destruction-event">entity destruction event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the  initial instant of an entity's destruction timespan, after which
it no longer becomes available for use.</p>

<div class="note">Tentative definition of destruction!</div>


<p>An <dfn id="dfn-start-event">activity start event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the instant an activity starts.</p>

<p>An <dfn id="dfn-end-event">activity end event</dfn> is the <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> that marks the instant an activity ends.</p>

</div>

<div id="event-ordering" class="section">
<h4><span class="secno">2.1.2 </span>Event Ordering</h4>

<p>To allow for minimalistic clock assumptions, like Lamport
[<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CLOCK">CLOCK</a></cite>], PROV-DM relies on a notion of relative ordering of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>,
without using physical clocks. This specification assumes that a partial order exists between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>.
</p>


<p>Specifically, <dfn id="dfn-follows">follows</dfn> is a partial
order between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>, indicating that an <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> occurs at the same time as or after another.
For symmetry, <dfn id="dfn-precedes">precedes</dfn> is defined as
the inverse of follows. (Hence, these relations are reflexive and transitive.)</p>


<p> How such partial order is realized in practice is beyond the scope
of this specification.  This specification only assumes that
each <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> can be mapped to an instant in some form of
timeline. The actual mapping is not in scope of this
specification. Likewise, whether this timeline is formed of a single
global timeline or whether it consists of multiple Lamport's style
clocks is also beyond this specification.  It is anticipated
that <a href="#dfn-follows" class="internalDFN">follows</a> and <a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a> correspond to some ordering
over this timeline.
</p>


<p>This specification introduces a set of "temporal interpretation"
rules allowing the derivation of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> ordering constraints from
provenance descriptions.  According to such temporal interpretation,
descriptions <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> satisfy such constraints.  We note that the
actual verification of such ordering constraints is outside the
scope of this specification. </p>

<p>PROV-DM also allows for time observations to be inserted in specific
descriptions, for each recognized <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> introduced
in this specification.  The presence of a time observation for a
given <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> fixes the mapping of this <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> to the
timeline. It can also help with the verification of associated
ordering constraints (though, again, this verification is outside the
scope of this specification).

    <div id="section-attributes" class="section"> 
<h3><span class="secno">2.2 </span>Attributes in Entities and Beyond </h3>

<p>When we talk about things in the world in natural language and even when we assign identifiers, we are often imprecise in ways that make it difficult to clearly and unambiguously report
provenance: a resource with a URL may be understood as referring to a report available at that URL, the version of the report available there today, the report independent of where it is
hosted over time, etc.</p>

<p>From a provenance viewpoint, it is important to identify a "<em>partial state</em>" of something, i.e. something with some aspects that have been fixed, so that it becomes possible to express its provenance, and what causes that thing, with these specific aspects to be as such. </p>

<p>It is the purpose of attributes in PROV-DM to help fix some aspect of entities.
Indeed, we previously defined 
entities as things in the world one wants to provide provenance for;
we refine this definition as follows, using attribute-values to describe entities' "partial states", and linking them to the very existence of entities.</p>

<p>
An <dfn id="dfn-entity">entity</dfn> is a thing in the world one wants to provide provenance for and whose situation in the world is represented by some attribute-value pairs; an entity's attribute-value pairs remain unchanged during an entity's characterization interval, which  is defined as the period comprised between its <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> and its <a title="entity destruction event" href="#dfn-destruction-event" class="internalDFN">destruction event</a>.</p>

<p>An entity fixes some aspects of a thing and its situation in the
world. An alternative entity may fix other aspects, and its provenance
may be different.</p>






<div class="anexample" id="a-report-example">
Different users may take different perspectives on a resource with
a URL. For each perspective, an entity may be expressed:
<ul>
<li>a report available at a URL: fixes the nature of the thing, i.e. a document, and its location; </li>
<li>the version of the report available there today: fixes its version number, contents, and its date;</li>
<li>the report independent of where it is hosted and of its content over time: fixes the nature of the thing as a conceptual artifact.</li></ul>
The provenance of these three entities may differ, and may be along the following lines: 
<ul>
<li>the provenance of a report available at a URL may include: the act of publishing it and making it available at a given location, possibly under some license and access control;</li>
<li>the provenance of the version of the report available there today may include: the authorship of the specific content, and reference to imported content;</li>
<li>the provenance of the report independent of where it is hosted over time may include: the motivation for writing the report, the overall methodology for producing it, and the broad team
involved in it.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We do not assume that any entity is more important than any other; in fact, it is possible to describe the processing that occurred for the report to be commissioned, for
individual versions to be created, for those versions to be published at the given URL, etc., each via a different entity with attribute-value pairs that fix some aspect of the report appropriately.</p>

<p>Attributes are not restricted to entities, but they belong to a variety of PROV-DM objects, including activities, activity associations, responsibility chains, generations, usages, derivations, and alternates. Each object has its duration interval, and attribute-value pairs for a given object, are expected to be unchanged for the object's duration.</p>
</div>



    <div id="representation-term-assertion-inference" class="section"> 
<h3><span class="secno">2.3 </span>Description, Assertion, and Inference</h3>

<p>
PROV-DM is a provenance data model designed to express <em>descriptions</em> of the world. 
</p>

<div class="anexample">
A file at some point during its lifecycle, which includes multiple edits by multiple people, can be described by its type, its location in the file system, a creator, and content.  
</div>


<p>The data model is designed to capture activities that happened in the past, as opposed to activities
that may or will happen. 
However, this distinction is not formally enforced.
Therefore, all PROV-DM descriptions <em class="rfc2119" title="should">should</em> be interpreted as what has happened, as opposed to what may or will happen.</p>



<p> 
This specification does not prescribe the means by which descriptions can be arrived at; for example, descriptions can be composed on the basis of observations, reasoning, or any other means. 
</p>


<p>
Sometimes, inferences about the world can be made from descriptions
conformant to the PROV-DM data model. When this is the case, this
specification defines such inferences, allowing new descriptions
to be inferred from existing ones. Hence, descriptions of the world
can result either from direct assertion or from inference 
by application of inference rules defined by this specification.
</p>



</div>
<div class="issue"> We need to refine the definition of entity and activity, and all the concepts in general. This is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/track/issues/223">ISSUE-223</a>.</div>




    <div id="account-and-accountEntity" class="section">
      <h3><span class="secno">2.4 </span>Account and AccountEntity</h3>


<p>It is common for multiple provenance records to co-exist. For
instance, when emailing a file, there could be a provenance record
kept by the mail client, and another by the mail server. Such
provenance records may provide different explanations about something
happening in the world, because they are created by different parties
or observed by different witnesses. A given party could also create
multiple provenance records about an execution, to capture different
levels of details, targeted at different end-users: the programmer of
an experiment may be interested in a detailed log of execution, while
the scientists may focus more on the scientific-level description.
Given that multiple provenance records can co-exist, it is important
to have details about their origin, who they are attributed to, how
they were generated, etc.  In other words, an important requirement is
to be able to express the provenance of provenance. </p>

<p>
  <span class="glossary" id="glossary-account">
An <dfn id="dfn-account">account</dfn> is a named bundle of provenance descriptions.
</span>  PROV-DM does not provide an actual mechanism for creating accounts, i.e. for bundling up provenance descriptions and naming them.  Accounts <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> satisfy some properties:
</p><ul>
<li>An account can be seen as a container of provenance descriptions, hence its content <em class="rfc2119" title="may">may</em> change over time.</li>
<li>If an account's  set of descriptions changes over time, it increases monotonically with time. </li>
<li>A given description of e.g. an entity in a given account, in terms of its identifier and attribute-value pairs, does not change over time. </li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
The last point is important and needs to be discussed by the Working Group.
It indicates that within an account:
<ul>
<li>It is always possible to add new provenance descriptions, e.g. stating that a given entity was used by an activity.  This is very much an open world assumption.
</li><li>It is not permitted to add new attributes to a given entity (a form of closed world assumption from the attributes point of view), though it is always permitted to create a new description for an entity, which is a "copy" of the original description extended with novel attributes  (cf Example <a href="#merge-with-rename">merge-with-rename</a>).
</li></ul>
</div>

<p>
There is no construct in PROV-DM to create such named bundles. Instead, it is assumed that some mechanism, outside PROV-DM can create them.  However, from a provenance viewpoint, such accounts are things we may want to describe the provenance of. In order to be able to do so, we need to see accounts as entities, whose origin can be described using PROV-DM vocabulary. Thus, PROV-DM introduces the reserved type AccountEntity, defined as follows:
<span class="glossary" id="glossary-entity">
 <dfn id="concept-accountEntity">AccountEntity</dfn> is the category of entities that are accounts, i.e. named bundles of provenance descriptions.

<p>
An <dfn id="dfn-entity-1">entity</dfn> is a thing in the world one wants to provide provenance for and whose situation in the world is represented by some attribute-value pairs; an entity's attribute-value pairs remain unchanged during an entity's characterization interval, 
 i.e. a continuous interval between two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> in the world, namely its <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> and its <a title="entity destruction event" href="#dfn-destruction-event" class="internalDFN">destruction event</a>.</p>


Further considerations:
<ul>
<li>In order to describe something over several intervals, it is required to create multiple entities (either by direct
assertion or by inference), each with its own identifier (so as to allow potential dependencies between the various entity records).  


</li>

<li>There is no assumption that the set of attributes is complete and that the attributes are independent or orthogonal of each other.</li>

<li>A characterization interval may collapse into a single instant.</li>



</ul>



<div class="issue">The characterization interval of an entity record is currently implicit. Making it explicit would allow us to define alternateOf and specializationOf more precisely. 
Beginning and end of characterization interval could be expressed by attributes (similarly to activities).

<p>An activity is anything that involves entities. An activity is delimited by its <a title="activity start event" href="#dfn-start-event" class="internalDFN">start</a> and its <a title="activity end event" href="#dfn-end-event" class="internalDFN">end</a> events; hence, it occurs over
an interval delimited by two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>. However, an activity need not mention time information, nor duration, because they may not be known.
An activity's attribute-value pairs remain unchanged during an activity's interval, i.e. an interval between two instantaneous events in the world, namely its <a title="activity start event" href="#dfn-start-event" class="internalDFN">start</a> event and its <a title="activity end event" href="#dfn-end-event" class="internalDFN">end</a> event.
</p>

<div class="interpretation-forward">
For the interpretation of an activity, see <a href="#start-precedes-end">start-precedes-end</a>.
</div>

<p>Further considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>An activity is not an entity.
Indeed,  an entity exists in full at
any point in its lifetime, persists during this
interval, and preserves the characteristics that makes it
identifiable.  In contrast, an activity is something that happens,
unfolds or develops through time, but is typically not identifiable by
the characteristics it exhibits at any point during its duration. 
This distinction is similar to the distinction between 
'continuant' and 'occurrent' in logic [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-Logic">Logic</a></cite>].</li>

<pre class="codeexample">wasInformedBy(a2,a1)

<p> We cannot infer <span class="name">wasInformedBy(a3,a1)</span> from these expressions. Indeed,

assumptions [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CLOCK">CLOCK</a></cite>] in the form of a reflexive, transitive partial order <a href="#dfn-follows" class="internalDFN">follows</a>
(and its inverse <a href="#dfn-precedes" class="internalDFN">precedes</a>) between <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a>.  Furthermore,
PROV-DM assumes the existence of a mapping from <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> to time clocks,
though the actual mapping is not in scope of this specification.</p>

<p>Given that provenance consists of a description of past entities
and activities, to be meaningful provenance descriptions <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em>
satisfy <em>instantaneous event ordering constraints</em>, which we introduce in
this section.  For instance, an entity can only be used after it was
generated; hence, we say that an entity's <a title="entity generation
event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> precedes any of this
entity's <a title="entity usage event" href="#dfn-usage-event" class="internalDFN">usage event</a>.  Should this
ordering constraint be proven invalid, the associated generation and
usage could not be credible.  The rest of this section defines
the <dfn id="dfn-temporal-interpretation">temporal interpretation</dfn> of provenance descriptions as a
set of instantaneous event ordering constraints. </p>


<p>PROV-DM also allows for time observations to be inserted in
specific provenance descriptions, for each of the four kinds
of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> introduced in this specification.  The
presence of a time observation for a given <a>instantaneous event</a> fixes the
mapping of this <a>instantaneous event</a> to the timeline. The presence of time
information in a provenance description instantiates the ordering constraint with
that time information. It is expected that such instantiated
constraint can help corroborate provenance information. We anticipate
that verification algorithms could be developedm, though this
verification is outside the scope of this specification.
</p>

<p>The following figure summarizes the ordering constraints in a
graphical manner. For each subfigure, an event time line points to the
right. Activities are represented by rectangles, whereas entities are
represented by circles. Usage, generation and derivation are
represented by the corresponding edges between entities and
activities.  The four kind of <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous events</a> are represented by vertical
dotted lines (adjacent to the vertical sides of an activity's
rectangle, or intersecting usage and generation edges).  The ordering
constraints are represented by triangles: an occurrence of a triangle between two <a title="event" href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN">instantaneous event</a> vertical dotted lines represents that the event denoted by the left
line precedes the event denoted by the right line.</p>

<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">7. </span>PROV-DM Structural Constraints</h2>

<p><a href="#definitional-constraints">Section 4</a> provides definitional constraints for data model concepts.
<a href="#account-constraints">Section 5</a> introduces constraints on descriptions occurring in accounts.
<a href="#interpretation">Section 6</a> defines an interpretation of this data model, in terms of event ordering
constraints.  
This section introduces further constraints on the structure of PROV-DM descriptions.  Descriptions that satisfy these constraints are said to be <dfn id="dfn-structurally-well-formed">structurally well-formed</dfn>.  A
benefit of structurally well-formed provenance descriptions is that further inferences can be made, because descriptions are more precise, and therefore, richer. </p>

<p>According to the definition of a <a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation</a>, an entity becomes available after this entity's generation event, and does not exist before this event.  From this definition,
we conclude that PROV-DM does not allow for an entity to have two generations occurring at two different instants.
The rationale for this constraint is as follows.
 Two distinct <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation events</a> (by a same activity or by two distinct activities), occurring one after the other, necessarily create two distinct
entities; otherwise, the second <a title="entity generation event" href="#dfn-generation-event" class="internalDFN">generation event</a> would have resulted in an entity that existed before its creation, which contradicts the definition of
<a href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generation</a>.</p>

<p>So, PROV-DM allows for two distinct <a>generations</a>  <span class="name">g1</span> and <span class="name">g2</span> referencing a same entity provided they occur
<em>simultaneously</em>. 
<!-- (This means that <span class="name">g1</span> <a>precedes</a> <span class="name">g2</span> and <span class="name">g2</span> <a>precedes</a> <span class="name">g1</span>.) -->
  In practice, for such a simultaneous generation to occur, the generation event has to be unique and caused by a <em>single world activity</em>, though  provenance may contain
several  descriptions for the <em>same</em> world activity. 
</p>

<div class="anexample">
<p>
In the following assertions, a workflow execution  <span class="name">a0</span> consists of two sub-workflow executions  <span class="name">a1</span> and <span class="name">a2</span>.
Sub-workflow execution <span class="name">a2</span> generates entity <span class="name">e</span>, so does <span class="name">a0</span>.</p>
<pre class="codeexample">activity(a0,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
activity(a1,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
activity(a2,,,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
wasInformedBy(a2,a1)

wasGeneratedBy(e,a0)
wasGeneratedBy(e,a2)
</pre>
<p>So, we have two different <a title="generation" href="#dfn-Generation" class="internalDFN">generations</a> for entity <span class="name">e</span>.  Such an example is permitted in PROV-DM if the two activities denoted by <span class="name">a0</span> and <span class="name">a2</span> are a single thing happening  in the world
but described from different perspectives.</p>
</div>

<p>While this example is permitted in PROV-DM, it does not make the inter-relation between activities explicit, and  it mixes descriptions expressed from different perspectives together. 
While this may acceptable in some specific applications, it becomes challenging for inter-operability. Indeed, PROV-DM does not offer any relation describing the structure of activities.
  Such descriptions are said not be structurally well-formed.</p>

<p>Structurally well-formed provenance can be obtained by partitioning the generations into different accounts. This makes it clear that these generations provide alternative
descriptions of the same real-world generation event, rather than describing two distinct generation events for the same entity. When accounts are used, the example can be encoded as follows.</p>


<div class="anexample">
<p>
The same example is now revisited, with the following assertions that are structurally well-formed. Two accounts are introduced, and there is a single generation for entity <span class="name">e</span> per account.</p>

<p>In a first account, entitled "summary", we find:</p>
<pre class="codeexample">        activity(a0,t1,t2,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        wasGeneratedBy(e,a0)
</pre>
<p>In a second account, entitled "detail", we find:</p>
<pre class="codeexample">        activity(a1,t1,t3,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        activity(a2,t3,t2,[prov:type="workflow execution"])
        wasInformedBy(a2,a1)
        wasGeneratedBy(e,a2)
</pre>
</div>



<p>Structurally well-formed provenance satisfies some constraints, which force the structure of descriptions to be exposed by means of accounts. With these constraints satisfied, further
inferences can be made about structurally well-formed descriptons.
The uniqueness of generations in accounts is formulated as follows.
</p>

<div class="constraint" id="generation-uniqueness">Given an entity denoted by <span class="name">e</span>, two activities denoted by <span class="name">a1</span> and <span class="name">a2</span>, and two sets of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">attrs1</span> and <span class="name">attrs2</span>,
<span class="conditional">if</span> <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(id1,e,a1,attrs1)</span> and <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(id2,e,a2,attrs2)</span> exist in the scope of a given
account,
<span class="conditional">then</span> <span class="name">id1</span>=<span class="name">id2</span>, <span class="name">a1</span>=<span class="name">a2</span>  and <span class="name">attrs1</span>=<span class="name">attrs2</span>.
</div> 






<p>A further inference is permitted from derivations with an explicit activity and no usage: </p>
<div class="inference" id="derivation-use">
<p>Given an activity <span class="name">a</span>, entities  denoted by <span class="name">e1</span> and <span class="name">e2</span>, and  sets of attribute-value
pairs <span class="name">dAttrs</span>, <span class="name">gAttrs</span>,
<span class="conditional">if</span> <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1, a, dAttrs)</span> and <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e2,a,gAttrs)</span> hold, <span class="conditional">then</span> <span class="name">used(a,e1,uAttrs)</span> also holds
for some set of attribute-value pairs <span class="name">uAttrs</span>.
</p></div>
<p>This inference is justified by the fact that the entity denoted by <span class="name">e2</span> is generated by at most one activity in a given account
(see <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a>). Hence,  this activity is also the one referred to by the usage of <span class="name">e1</span>. 
</p>


<p>We note that the converse inference, does not hold.
From <span class="name">wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)</span> and <span class="name">used(a,e1)</span>, one cannot
derive <span class="name">wasGeneratedBy(e2,a,attrs2)</span> because identifier <span class="name">e1</span> may occur in usages performed by many activities, which may have not generated the entity denoted by <span class="name">e2</span>.</p>


<p>
An account is said to be structurally well-formed if
it satisfies the constraint  <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a>. If an account is structurally well-formed, it support the inference <a href="#derivation-use">derivation-use</a>.</p>

<p> Taking the union of two accounts is another account, 
formed by the union of the descriptions they respectively contain.  We note that the resulting union may or may not invalidate some constraints:
</p><ul>
<li> Two entity descriptions with a same identifier but different sets of attributes exist in each original account may invalidate <a href="#unique-description-in-account">unique-description-in-account</a> in the union, unless some form of description merging or renaming (as per <a href="#merge-with-rename">Example</a>) occurs.
</li><li> Structurally well-formed
accounts are not
closed under union because the
constraint <a href="#generation-uniqueness">generation-uniqueness</a> may no
longer be satisfied in the resulting union.  </li>
</ul>
<p>How to reconcile such accounts is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>

<!--

We see that ex:s_3 (the sculpture in its final state) was derived from ex:l_2 (containment) which was generated by ex:a2. However, ex:s_3 is not directly generated by ex:a2.  We may want to
consider an abbreviation for this: wasGeneratedBy*(ex:s_3,ex:a2).</p>

<div class="note">
Raw material taken from prov-dm3. Some further text required.
</div>


<div class="constraint" id="collection-parallel-insertions">
<p>One can have multiple assertions regarding the state of a collection following a <em>set</em> of insertions, for example:</p>
<pre class="codeexample">CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c1, k1, v1)
CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c1, k2, v2)
...
</pre>
<p>This is interpreted as <em>" <span class="name">c2</span> is the state that results from inserting  <span class="name">(k1, v1)</span>,  <span class="name">(k2, v2)</span> etc. into  <span class="name">c1</span>"</em></p>
</div>

<div class="note">
Shouldn't we have the same for deletion, and combination of insertion and deletion?
</div>


<div class="constraint" id="collection-branching-derivations">
It is possible to have multiple derivations from a single root collection, as shown in the following example.

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="EmptyCollection"])    // e is an empty collection
  entity(v1)
  entity(v2)
  entity(v3)
  entity(c1, [prov:type="Collection"])
  entity(c2, [prov:type="Collection"])
  entity(c3, [prov:type="Collection"])
  
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 = { (k1,v1) }
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c, k2, v2)       // c2 = { (k2 v2) }
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c3, c1, k3,v3)       // c3 = { (k1,v1),  (k3,v3) }
</pre>
</div>
</div>






<div class="constraint" id="collection-unique-ancestor">
Given the pair of assertions:
<pre class="codeexample">CollectionAfterInsertion(c, c1, k1, v1)
CollectionAfterInsertion(c, c2, k2, v2)
</pre>
it follows that  <span class="name">c1==c2</span>.
</div>

<div class="note">
Original text stated it follows that <span class="name">c1==c2, k1==k2, v1==v2</span>, because one cannot have two different derivations for the same final collection state. This is incompatible with parallel insertion constraint.
</div>


<div class="note">
Shouldn't we have the same for deletion, and combination of insertion and deletion?
</div>




<div class="constraint" id="collection-unique-value-for-key">
Given the following set of insertions:
<pre class="codeexample">CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k, v1)
CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k, v2)
</pre>
it follows that  <span class="name">v1==v2</span>.
</div>


<p>The state of a collection is only known to the extent that a chain of derivations starting from an empty collection can be found. Since a set of assertions regarding a collection's evolution may be incomplete, so is the reconstructed state obtained by querying those assertions. In general, all assertions reflect the asserter's partial knowledge of a sequence of data transformation events. In the particular case of collection evolution, in which the asserter  <em>knows</em> that some of the state changes may have been missed, then the more generic  <a href="#Derivation-Relation">derivation</a> relation should be used to signal that some updates may have occurred, which cannot be precisely asserted as insertions or removals. The following two examples illustrate this.</p>

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="collection"])    // e is a collection, possibly not empty
  entity(v1)
  entity(v2, [prov:type="collection"])    // v2 is a collection

  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 <em>includes</em> { (k1,v1) } but may contain additional unknown pairs
  CollectionAfterInsertion(c2, c1, k2, v2)      // c2 includes { (k1,v1), (k2 v2) } where v2 is a collection with unknown state
</pre>
</div>
  In the example, the state of <span class="name">c2</span> is only partially known because the collection is constructed from partially known other collections.

<div class="anexample">
<pre class="codeexample">  entity(c, [prov:type="emptyCollection"])    // e is an empty collection
  entity(v1)
  entity(v2)

  CollectionAfterInsertion(c1, c, k1, v1)       // c1 = { (k1,v1) }
  wasDerivedFrom(c2, c1)                        // the asserted knows that c2 is somehow derived from c1, but cannot assert the precise sequence of updates
    CollectionAfterInsertion(c3, c2, k2, v2)       
</pre>

<p>Here  <span class="name">c3</span> includes <span class="name">{ (k2 v2) }</span> but the earlier "gap" leaves uncertainty regarding  <span class="name">(k1,v1)</span>  (it may have been removed) or any other pair that may have been added as part of the derivation activities.</p>
</div>

<section id="resource-section">
<h2>Resources, URIs, Entities, Identifiers, and Scope</h2> 

<p>This specification  introduces the  notion of an identifiable entity in the world. In PROV-DM, an entity record is a representation of such an identifiable entity. An entity record
includes an identifier identifying this entity.  Identifiers are qualified names, which can be mapped to IRIs.  </p>

<p>The term 'resource' is used in a general sense
      for whatever might be identified by a URI [[!RFC3986]].  On the Web, a URI denotes a resource, without any expectation that the resource is accessed. </p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to clarify the relationship between resource and the notions of entity and  entity record. </p>  

<p>In the context of PROV-DM, a resource is just a thing in the world. One may take multiple perspectives on such a thing and its situation in the world, fixing some its aspects.</p>

<p> We refer to the <a href="#a-report-example">example</a> of section <a href="#conceptualization">2.1</a> for a resource (at some URL) and three different perspectives, referred to as
entities.  Three different entity records can be expressed for this report, which in the PROV-N sample below, are expressed within a same account.
</p>

<pre>
container
prefix app http://example.org/app/
prefix cr  http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc1,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:0, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           entity(app:1, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])
           entity(app:2, [ prov:type="Document", cr:author="John" ])
        ...)
endContainer
</pre>

<p>Each entity record contains an identifier that is unique in
account <span class="name">acc1</span>, and therefore locally
identifies the entity record it is contained in.  In this example,
three identifiers were minted.</p>

<p>Given that the report is a resource denoted by the URI <span class="name">http://example.org/crime.txt</span>, we could simply use this URI as the identifier of an entity. This would
avoid us minting new URIs.  Hence, the report URI would play a double role: as a URI it denotes a resource accessible at that URI, and as an identifier in a PROV-DM record, it helps identify
a specific characterization of this report. A given identifier occurring in an entity record must be unique within the scope of an account. Hence, below, all entities records have been given
the same identifier but appear in the scope of different accounts, so as to satisfy  <a href="#identifiable-term-in-account">identifiable-term-in-account</a>.</p>

<pre>
container 
prefix app http://example.org/
prefix cr  http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc2,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           ...)

   account(acc3,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])
           ...)

   account(acc4,
           http://example.org/asserter1,
           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:author="John" ])
           ...)
endContainer
</pre>

<p>In this case, the qualified name  <span class="name">app:crime.txt</span> maps to URI <span class="name">http://example.org/crime.txt</span> still denotes the same resource; however, the
perspectives we take about that resource are expressed by multiple entity records, happening to all contain the same identifier but in different accounts. </p>

<p> Alternatively, if we need to assert the existence of two different perspectives on the report within the same account, then alternate identifiers MUST be used, one of them being allowed
to be the resource URI.</p>

<pre>
container 
 prefix app  http://example.org/
 prefix app2 http://example.org/app/
 prefix cr   http://example.org/crime/

   account(acc5,
           http://example.org/asserter1,

           entity(app:crime.txt, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt" ])
           entity(app2:1, [ prov:type="Document", cr:path="http://example.org/crime.txt", cr:version="2.1", cr:content="...", cr:date="2011-10-07" ])

           ...)

<!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">9. </span>Refining Provenance Descriptions</h2>

<div class="note">Purely tentative</div>

<p>In this section, we successively review refined provenance descriptions, and examine their meaning, in light of the constraints introduced in this specification. </p>


<ol> 
<li>First, let us consider a small set of three descriptions, including an entity, an agent, and an attribution relation.
<pre>entity(tr:prov-dm)
agent(w3:Consortium)
wasAttributedTo(tr:prov-dm,w3:Consortium)
</pre>
<p>The entity denoted by <span class="name">tr:prov-dm</span> does not contain any attribute besides its identifier.  Without any further detail, this entity is simply the resource denoted by <span class="name">tr:prov-dm</span>, whatever its state over time. This resource has multiple versions including <span class="name">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215</span> and <span class="name">tr:WD-prov-dm-20111018</span>.
Likewise, the second line simply is a description for a resource denoted by <span class="name">w3:Consortium</span>, nothing less, nothing more.</p>
<p>The third description should be interpreted as: whatever changes entity <span class="name">tr:prov-dm</span> may have gone through, it is always attributed to the <span class="name">w3:Consortium</span> agent.</p>
</li>


<li>Second, the descriptions are bundled up as an account with name <span class="name">ex:acc1</span>:
<pre>entity(tr:prov-dm)
agent(ex:Simon)
wasAttributedTo(tr:prov-dm,ex:Simon)
</pre>
and provenance details are available for <span class="name">ex:acc1</span>, namely the generation time for the provenance. 
<pre>entity(ex:acc1, [prov:type="AccountEntity"])
wasGeneratedBy(ex:acc1,,2011-12-15T12:00:00)
</pre>
<div class="note">
What is the meaning here?  Is it any different? Are stating anything about newer version of tr:prov-dm that occur after 2011-12-15T12:00:00?
</div>

</li><li> A generation event for <span class="name">tr:prov-dm</span> is provided.
<pre>entity(tr:prov-dm)
agent(ex:Simon)
wasGeneratedBy(tr:prov-dm,,2011-12-15T12:00:00)
wasAttributedTo(tr:prov-dm,ex:Simon)
</pre>
<div class="note">
What is the meaning here?  that only the version that was created by this event is attributed to ex:Simon, but not previous ones. This means that it is not specfied whether he was an author in anterior versions.
</div>

</li>


<li> A destruction event for <span class="name">tr:prov-dm</span> is provided.
<pre>entity(tr:prov-dm)
agent(ex:Simon)
wasGeneratedBy(tr:prov-dm,,2011-12-15T12:00:00)
wasDestroyedBy(tr:prov-dm,,2012-02-02T12:00:00)
wasAttributedTo(tr:prov-dm,ex:Simon)
</pre>
<div class="note"> 
Speculative, since we have not defined the destruction event (yet?.
What is the meaning here?  that only the versions that existed during this characterization interval were attributed to ex:Simon.

</li>

</ol>

<li id='attribute-occurrence-in-entity-record'>The attributes
occurring in an entity record MUST be declared in the namespace
referred to by their prefix according to
<a href="#term-attribute">Section term-attribute</a>. Furthermore,
for each attribute, a namespace also declares the number of
