  <div id="abstract" class="introductory section"><h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>
    This document provides an intuitive introduction and guide to the
    PROV specification for provenance on the Web. PROV is a core data model for
    provenance for building representations of the entities, people and
    processes involved in producing a piece of data or thing in the world.
    This primer explains the fundamental PROV concepts and provides examples 
    of its use.  The primer is intended as a starting point for those wishing
    to create or use PROV data.
   </p>

   
<!--  p>
    This is a document for internal discussion, which will ultimately
    evolve in the first Public Working Draft of the Primer.</p  -->

   This document is part of a set of specifications aiming to define the
   various aspects that are necessary to achieve the vision of
   interoperable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous
   environments such as the Web. This document is an
   intuitive introduction and guide with simple illustrative examples

      <h4 id="prov-family-of-specifications">PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
The PROV family of specifications aims to define the various aspects that are necessary to achieve the vision of inter-operable
interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.  
The specifications are as follows.
<ul>
<li> PROV-PRIMER, a primer for the PROV data model (this document),</li>
<li> PROV-DM, the PROV data model for provenance,</li>
<li> PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS, a set of constraints applying to the PROV data model,</li>
<li> PROV-N, a notation for provenance aimed at human consumption,</li>
<li> PROV-O, the PROV ontology, an OWL-RL ontology allowing the mapping of PROV to RDF;</li>
<li> PROV-AQ, the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance; </li>
<li> PROV-SEM, a formal semantics for the PROV data model.</li>
<li> PROV-XML, an XML schema for the PROV data model.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-read-the-prov-family-of-specifications">How to read the PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
<ul>
<li>The primer is the entry point to PROV offering a pedagogical presentation of the provenance model.</li>
<li>The Linked Data and Semantic Web community should focus on PROV-O defining PROV classes and properties specified in an OWL-RL ontology. For further details, PROV-DM and PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS specify the constraints applicable to the data model, and its interpretation. PROV-SEM provides a mathematical semantics.</li>
<li>The XML community should focus on PROV-XML defining an XML schema for PROV-DM. Further details can also be found in PROV-DM, PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS, and PROV-SEM.</li>
<li>Developers seeking to retrieve or publish provenance should focus of PROV-AQ.</li>
<li>Readers seeking to implement other PROV serializations
should focus on PROV-DM and PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS.  PROV-O, PROV-N, PROV-XML offer examples of mapping to RDF, text, and XML, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    This primer document provides an accessible introduction to the PROV 
    specification for provenance on the Web.  
    The <i>provenance</i> of digital objects represents their origins.  PROV is a 
    proposed specification to represent provenance records, 
    which contain <i>descriptions</i> of the entities 
    and activities involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing a 
    given object.
    For the remainder of this document, we use the term 'provenance' to refer also
    to records of provenance, except where the distinction is important for clarity.
    By knowing the provenance of an object, we can make determinations 
    about how to use it.  Provenance can be used for many purposes, such as 
    understanding how data was collected so it can be meaningfully used, determining 
    ownership and rights over an object, making judgments about information to 
    determine whether to trust it, verifying that the process and steps used to obtain a 
    result complies with given requirements, and reproducing how something was generated.
   </p>

   <p>
    As a specification for provenance, PROV accommodates all those different uses 
    of provenance.  Different people may have different perspectives on provenance, 
    and as a result different types of information might be captured in provenance records.  
    One perspective might focus on <i>agent-centered provenance</i>, that is, what entities 
    were involved in generating or manipulating the information in question.  For example, 
    in the provenance of a picture in a news article we might capture the photographer who 
    took it, the person that edited it, and the newspaper that published it. A second perspective 
    might focus on <i>object-centered provenance</i>, by tracing the origins of portions of a 
    document to other documents. An example is having a web page that was assembled from content
    from a news article, quotes of interviews with experts, and a chart that plots data from a 
    government agency.  A third perspective one might take is on <i>process-centered provenance</i>, 
    capturing the actions and steps taken to generate the information in question.  For example, a 
    chart may have been generated by invoking a service to retrieve data from a database, then 
    extracting certain statistics from the data using some statistics package, and finally 
    processing these results with a graphing tool.
   </p>

   <p>
    Provenance records are metadata.  There are other kinds of metadata that is 
    not provenance.  For example, the size of an image is metadata of 
    that image but it is not provenance.
    </p>
    
   <p>
    For general background on provenance, a 
    comprehensive overview of requirements, use cases, prior research, and proposed 
    vocabularies for provenance are available from the 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/XGR-prov/">Final Report of the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Provenance Incubator Group</a>.  
    That document contains three general scenarios 
    that may help identify the provenance aspects of planned applications and 
    help plan the design of a provenance system.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    This primer document aims to ease the adoption of the PROV specifications by providing:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>An intuitive explanation of how PROV models provenance. A detailed description of
    all the concepts and relations in the PROV Data Model is provided in [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>].</li>
    <li>A simple self-contained example that illustrates how to produce and use PROV assertions, highlighting how 
    to combine PROV with other popular vocabularies such as FOAF and Dublin Core.  A description
    of the formal PROV ontology (PROV-O) can be found in [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-O">PROV-O</a></cite>].</li>
    <li>Example snippets using a notation of PROV designed for human
    consumption (PROV-N).  Details of this notation can be found at [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-N">PROV-N</a></cite>].</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>There are additional reference documents for PROV that are not covered in this 
   primer, including the PROV Access and Query aspects of the specification (PROV-AQ), 
   the constraints on the PROV data model (PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS), 
   a formal semantics of the PROV data model (PROV-SEM), and the PROV XML notation 
   (PROV-XML). </p>

<h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Intuitive overview of PROV</h2>

   <p>
    This section provides an intuitive explanation of the main concepts in PROV. 
    As with the rest of this document, it should be treated as a starting point for
    understanding the model. The PROV-DM data model document [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>]
    provides precise definitions and constraints to be used.
   </p>
   <p>
    The following diagram provides a high level overview of the structure of PROV records,
    limited to some key PROV concepts discussed in this document.
    The diagram is the same that appears in the [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-PROV-DM">PROV-DM</a></cite>] document.
    Note that because PROV is meant to describe how things were created or delivered, 
    PROV relations are named so they can be used in assertions about the past.  
    This also affects the domain and range of the relations in PROV.  
   </p>

   </div>

   <div id="entities" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.1 </span>Entities</h3>

    <p>
     In PROV, physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of thing are called
     <i>entities</i>.
     Examples of such entities are a web page, a chart, and a spellchecker.
     Provenance records can describe the provenance of entities, and
     an entity’s provenance may refer to many other entities.  For example, a document D is
     an entity whose provenance refers to other entities such as a chart inserted into D,
     and the dataset that was used to create that chart.
     Entities may be described as having different attributes and
     be described from different perspectives.  For example,
     document D as stored in my file system, the second version of document D, 
     and D as an evolving document,
     are three distinct entities for which we may describe provenance.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="activities" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.2 </span>Activities</h3>

    <p>
     <i>Activities</i> are how entities come into 
     existence and how their attributes change to become new entities, 
     often making use of previously existing entities to achieve this. 
     They are
     dynamic aspects of the world, such as actions, processes, etc.
     For example, if the second version of document D was generated 
     by a translation from the first version of the document in another language,
     then this translation is an activity.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="use-and-generation" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.3 </span>Use and Generation</h3>
    <p>
     Activities <i>generate</i> new entities.
     For example, writing a document brings the document into existence, while
     revising the document brings a new version into existence.
     Generation does not always occur at the end of an activity, and an activity may generate entities
     part-way through.
     Activities also make <i>use</i> of entities. For example, revising a document
     to fix spelling mistakes uses the original version of the document as well
     as a list of corrections. 
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="agents-and-responsibility" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.4 </span>Agents and Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
     An <i>agent</i> takes a role in an activity such 
     that the agent can be assigned some degree of <i>responsibility</i> for the activity taking 
     place.
     An agent can be a person, a piece of software, an inanimate object, an organization, or
     other entities that may be ascribed responsibility.
     When an agent has some responsibility for an activity, PROV says the agent was
     <i>associated</i> with the activity, where several agents may be associated with
     an activity and vice-versa.
     Consider a chart displaying some statistics 
     regarding crime rates over time in a linear regression.  To represent the 
     provenance of that chart, we could state that the person who created the 
     chart was an agent involved in its creation, and that the software used to 
     create the chart was also an agent involved in that activity.
     An agent may be <i>acting on behalf</i> of others, e.g. an employee on behalf of their
     organization, and we can express such chains of responsibility in the provenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     We can also describe that an entity is <i>attributed</i> to an agent to express
     the agent's responsibility for that entity, possibly along with other agents.
     This description can be understood as a shorthand
     for saying that the agent was responsible for the activity which generated
     the entity.
    </p>
    <p>
    One may want to describe the provenance of an agent.  For example, an organization 
    responsible for the creation of a report may evolve over time as the report is written as
    some members leave and others join.  To make provenance assertions about an agent in PROV ,
    the agent must be declared explicitly both as an agent and as an entity.
    </p>

   </div>

   <div id="roles" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.5 </span>Roles</h3>
    <p>
     A <i>role</i> is a description of the function or the part that an entity 
     played in an activity.  Roles specify
     the relationship between an entity and an activity, whether
     how an activity used an entity or generated an entity.  Roles also specify how agents are
     involved in an activity, qualifying their participation in the activity or
     specifying for what aspect of it each agent was responsible.
     For example, an agent may play the role of &quot;editor&quot; in an activity that uses
     one entity in the role of &quot;document to be edited&quot; and another in the role of
     &quot;addition to be made to the document&quot;, to generate a further entity in the role of &quot;edited document&quot;.
     Roles are application specific, so PROV does not define any particular roles.
    </p>
    
<!-- p>Roles are intended as an extension point in the model; it is expected users will define and use custom role taxonomies.  Role interpretation is application specific.</p  -->

   </div>

   <div id="derivation-and-revision" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.6 </span>Derivation and Revision</h3>
    <p>
     When one entity's existence, content, characteristics and so on are
     at least partly due to another entity, then we say that the former was
     <i>derived</i> from the latter. For example, one document may contain
     material copied from another, 
     and a chart was derived from the data that it illustrates.
    </p>
    <p>
     PROV allows some common, specialized kinds of derivation to be described.
     For example, a given entity, such as a document, may go through multiple <i>revisions</i> 
     (also called versions and other comparable terms) over time. Between revisions,
     one or more attributes of the entity may change. 
     In PROV, the result of each revision is a new entity.
     PROV allows one to relate those entities by making a description that 
     one was a revision of another.
     Another specialized kind of derivation is to say that one entity, commonly
     a document, <i>quotes</i> from another.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="plans" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.7 </span>Plans</h3>
    <p>
     Activities may follow pre-defined procedures, such as recipes, tutorials, instructions, or workflows.
     PROV refers to these, in general, as <i>plans</i>, and allows the description that a plan was followed, by agents,
     in executing an activity.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="time" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.8 </span>Time</h3>
    <p>
     Time is often a critical aspect of provenance.
     PROV allows the timing of significant events to be described, including
     when an entity was generated or used, or when an activity started
     and finished. For example, the model can be used to describe facts such as when a new
     version of a document was created (generation time), or when a document was
     edited (start and end of the editing activity).
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="alternate-entities-and-specialization" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">2.9 </span>Alternate Entities and Specialization</h3>
    <p>
     Entities are defined in a flexible way in PROV, allowing for different
     perspectives to be taken as appropriate for the application. The following
     are examples illustrate this idea.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>The same entity can appear with different descriptions in a provenance record
     because each appearance emphasizes different aspects of the entity, e.g.
     a book may be described by its title in one place and by its author and publication date
     in another.</li>
     <li>The same entity can evolve over time into different 
     versions, e.g. a document that is repeatedly updated and has 
     subsequent releases over time.</li>
     <li>The same entity can be copied 
     or replicated, e.g. a document may be copied to several directories.</li>
     <li>An entity can go through different incarnations, e.g.
     a committee producing a report may have a set of members when the report 
     is first released and have a different set of members when an update of
     the report is released.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       In all these situations, 
     the more specific entities (the versions, copies, incarnations) can be said in PROV to be <i>specializations</i>
     of the more general entity (the book, the document or the committee as a general entity).
     The specific entities in each example are also <i>alternates</i> of each other, as they are specializations
     of the same general entity.
     Being aware that two entities are alternates allows those
     consuming the PROV data to know that understanding the provenance of one entity is salient
     to understanding the provenance of the other.  Knowing that alternate entities are 
     specializations of another allows a consumer of PROV to refer to the general entity
     with a unique identifier even though it is specified as different alternates 
     throughout the provenance records.

<h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Examples of Key Concepts in PROV</h2>

   <p>
    In the following sections, we show how PROV can be used to model 
    provenance in a specific example scenario.
   </p>
   <p>
    We include samples of how the formal ontology (PROV-O)
    can be used to represent the PROV descriptions as RDF triples.
    These are shown using the Turtle notation [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-TURTLE">TURTLE</a></cite>]. In 
    the latter depictions, the namespace prefix <b>prov</b> denotes 
    terms from the PROV ontology, while <b>ex</b> denotes terms specific to the example.
    We illustrate in these examples how PROV can be used in combination with other
    languages, such as FOAF and Dublin Core (with namespace prefix <b>foaf</b> and 
    <b>dcterms</b> respectively). </p>

   <p>We also provide a representation of the examples in the Provenance
    Notation, PROV-N, used in the data model document. The full PROV-N data 
    for the examples in this section is
    included in the appendix.</p>

   <div id="entities-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.1 </span>Entities</h3>

    <p>
     An online newspaper publishes an article with a chart about crime statistics making using of data (GovData) provided through a government portal. 
     The article includes a chart based on the data, with data values composed (aggregated) by
     geographical regions.
    </p>
    <p>
     A blogger, Betty, looking at the article, spots what she thinks to be an error in the chart.
     Betty retrieves a record of the provenance of the article, describing how it was created.
    </p>
    <p>Betty finds the following descriptions of entities in the provenance:</p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:article     a prov:Entity ;
               dcterms:title &quot;Crime rises in cities&quot; .
ex:dataset1    a prov:Entity .
ex:regionList  a prov:Entity .
ex:composition a prov:Entity .
ex:chart1      a prov:Entity .</pre>
    <p>
     These statements, in order, refer to the article (<code>ex:article</code>),
     an original data set (<code>ex:dataSet1</code>),
     a list of regions (<code>ex:regionList</code>), 
     data aggregated by region (<code>ex:composition</code>), 
     and a chart (<code>ex:chart1</code>), and state that each is an entity.
     Any entity may have attributes not specific to provenance, such as the title
     of the article, expressed using <code>dcterms:title</code> above.
    </p>
    <p>
     PROV data is commonly visualized for human consumption using particular conventions,
     which we will introduce over the following sections. To start with, entities
     are denoted using ovals, as shown below.
    </p>
    <img src="images/entities.png" alt="Visualization of the example entities" />
   </div>

   <div id="activities-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.2 </span>Activities</h3>

    <p>
     Further, the provenance describes that there was
     an activity (<code>ex:compile</code>) denoting the compilation of the
     chart from the data set.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compile a prov:Activity .</pre>
    <p>
     The provenance also includes reference to the more specific steps involved in this compilation,
     which are first composing the data by region (<code>ex:compose</code>) and then generating the
     chart graphic (<code>ex:illustrate</code>).
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose    a prov:Activity .
ex:illustrate a prov:Activity .</pre>
    <p>
     In visualizations of the PROV data, activities are depicted as rectangles, as below.
    </p>
    <img src="images/activities.png" alt="Visualization of the example activities" />
   </div>

   <div id="use-and-generation-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.3 </span>Use and Generation</h3>

    <p>
     Concluding the basic description of what occurred, the provenance 
     describes the key relations among the above
     entities and activities, i.e. the use of an entity by an activity,
     or the generation of an entity by an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, the descriptions below state that the composition activity
     (<code>ex:compose</code>) used the original data set, that it used the list of
     regions, and that the composed data was generated by this activity.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose      prov:used           ex:dataSet1 ;
                prov:used           ex:regionList .
ex:composition  prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:compose .</pre>
    <p>
     Similarly, the chart graphic creation activity (<code>ex:illustrate</code>)
     used the composed data, and the chart was generated by this activity.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:illustrate prov:used           ex:composition .
ex:chart1     prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:illustrate .</pre>
    <p>
     In visualizing the PROV data, usage and generation are connections between
     entities and activities.
    </p>
    <img src="images/use-generate.png" alt="Connection of the entities and activities by use and generation links" />
   </div>

   <div id="agents-and-responsibility-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.4 </span>Agents and Responsibility</h3>

    <p>
     Digging deeper, Betty wants to know who compiled the chart.
     Betty sees that Derek was involved in both the composition and
     chart creation activities:
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose    prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:derek .
ex:illustrate prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:derek .</pre>
    <p>
     The record for Derek provides the
     following information, of which the first lines are PROV-O statements that
     Derek is an agent, specifically a person, followed by (non-PROV) statements
     giving general properties of Derek.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:derek a prov:Agent ;
         a prov:Person ;
         foaf:givenName &quot;Derek&quot;^^xsd:string ;
         foaf:mbox      &lt;mailto:derek@example.org&gt; .</pre>
    <p>
     Derek works as part of an organization, Chart Generators Inc, and so the provenance
     declares that he acts on their behalf. Note that the organization is itself
     an agent.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:derek prov:actedOnBehalfOf ex:chartgen .

            a prov:Organization ;
            foaf:name &quot;Chart Generators Inc&quot; .</pre>
    <p>
     Finally, there is an explicit statement in the provenance that the chart was
     attributed to Derek.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:chart1 prov:wasAttributedTo ex:derek .</pre>
    <p>

   <div id="roles-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.5 </span>Roles</h3>

    <p>
     For Betty to understand where the error lies, she needs to have more detailed 
     information on how entities have been used in and generated 
     by activities.  Betty has determined that <code>ex:compose</code> used 
     entities <code>ex:regionList</code> and <code>ex:dataSet1</code>, but she does not 
     know what function these entities played in the processing.  Betty 
     also knows that <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with the activities, but she does 
     not know if Derek was the analyst responsible for determining how the data 
     should be composed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The above information is described as roles in the provenance. The composition
     activity involved entities in four roles: the data to be composed (<code>ex:dataToCompose</code>),
     the regions to aggregate by (<code>ex:regionsToAggregateBy</code>), the
     resulting composed data (<code>ex:composedData</code>), and the
     analyst doing the composition (<code>ex:analyst</code>).
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:dataToCompose        a prov:Role .
ex:regionsToAggregateBy a prov:Role .
ex:composedData         a prov:Role .
ex:analyst              a prov:Role .</pre>
    <p>
     Examples in the sections above show descriptions of the simple facts that the
     composition activity used, generated and was enacted by entities/agents.
     For example, the usage of the data set by the compose activity is expressed
     as follows.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose prov:used ex:dataSet1 .</pre>
    <p>     
     The
     provenance can contain more details of exactly how these entities and agents
     were involved in the activity. 
     To express this, PROV-O refers to <i>qualified usage</i>, <i>qualified generation</i>, etc.,
     which are descriptions consisting of several statements about how use, generation, etc. took place.
     For example, we may describe the plan followed by an agent in performing an activity, or
     the time at which an activity generated an entity, both illustrated later.
     Another example of qualified involvement is the role an entity played in an activity.
     The descriptions below state
     that the composition activity (<code>ex:compose</code>) included the usage
     of the government data set (<code>ex:dataSet1</code>) in the role of the data
     to be composed (<code>ex:dataToCompose</code>).
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose prov:qualifiedUsage [
              a prov:Usage ;
              prov:entity  ex:dataSet1 ;
              prov:hadRole ex:dataToCompose 
] .</pre>
    <p>
     This can then be distinguished from the same activity's usage of the list of
     regions because the roles played are different.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose prov:qualifiedUsage [
              a prov:Usage ;
              prov:entity  ex:regionList ;
              prov:hadRole ex:regionsToAggregateBy
] .</pre>
    <p>
     Similarly, the provenance includes descriptions that the same activity was
     enacted in a particular way by Derek, so it indicates that he had the role of 
     <code>ex:analyst</code>, and that the entity <code>ex:composition</code> took the role of the composed
     data in what the activity generated:
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:compose  prov:qualifiedAssociation [
              a  prov:Association ;
              prov:agent    ex:derek ;
              prov:hadRole  ex:analyst
] .
ex:composition prov:qualifiedGeneration [
                   a prov:Generation ;
                   prov:activity  ex:compose ;
                   prov:hadRole   ex:composedData
] .</pre>
    <p>
     Depicting the above visually, we have the following.
    </p>
    <img src="images/roles.png" alt="Provenance graph annotated with roles played by entities and agents" />
   </div>

   <div id="derivation-and-revision-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.6 </span>Derivation and Revision</h3>

    <p>
     After looking at the detail of the compilation activity, there appears
     to be nothing wrong, so Betty concludes the error is in the government dataset. 
     She looks at the dataset <code>ex:dataSet1</code>, 
     and sees that it is missing data from one of the zipcodes in the area.  She contacts
     the government agency, and a new version of GovData is created, declared to be the
     next revision of the data. The provenance of this new dataset,
     <code>ex:dataSet2</code>, states that it is a revision of the
     old data set, <code>ex:dataSet1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:dataSet2 a prov:Entity ;
            prov:wasRevisionOf ex:dataSet1 .</pre>
    <p>
     Derek notices that there is a new dataset available and creates a new chart based on the revised data, 
     using another compilation activity. Betty checks the article again at a
     later point, and wants to know if it is based on the old or new GovData.
     She sees a new description stating that the new chart is derived from the new dataset.
    </p>
    <pre class="example turtle">ex:chart2 a prov:Entity ;
          prov:wasDerivedFrom ex:dataSet2 .</pre>
    <p>and that the new chart is a revision of the original one:
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:chart2 a prov:Entity ;
            prov:wasRevisionOf ex:chart1 .</pre>
    <p>
     Derivation and revision are connections between entities, and so depicted
     with arrows in our visualization.

   <div id="plans-1" class="section">

    <p>
     Betty then wishes to know whether the new data set correctly addresses
     the error that existed before. The provenance of the new dataset,
     <code>ex:dataSet2</code>, describes not only who performed the corrections,
     Edith, but also what instructions she followed in doing so (in PROV terms, the plan).
     First, the correction activity (<code>ex:correct</code>), the person who corrected
     it, Edith (<code>ex:edith</code>), and the correction instructions (<code>ex:instructions</code>)
     are described.
    </p><pre class="turtle example">ex:correct      a prov:Activity .
ex:edith        a prov:Agent, prov:Person .
ex:instructions a prov:Plan .</pre>
    <p>
     The connection between them is expressed in PROV-O using a qualified association giving details of
     how Edith was associated with the correction activity,
     including that she followed the above correction instructions.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:correct prov:qualifiedAssociation [
               a Association ;
               prov:agent   ex:edith ;
               prov:hadPlan ex:instructions
           ] .
ex:dataSet2 prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:correct .</pre>
    <p>
     Plans are additional information about the connection from an activity to
     an agent, and so, in our visualization, connect to the link between them.

   <div id="time-1" class="section">
    <h3><span class="secno">3.8 </span>Time</h3>

    <p>
     The government agency that produced GovData is concerned to know how long
     the incorrect chart was in circulation before the corrected chart was created.
     That is, they wish to compare the times at which the original and the corrected
     charts were generated. Time of generation is expressed in PROV-O using a qualified
     description of the generation. The snippet below shows that the second chart
     was generated roughly a month after the first.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:chart1 prov:qualifiedGeneration [
               a prov:Generation ;
               prov:activity ex:compile ;

] .</pre>
    <p>
     To ensure their procedures are efficient, the agency also wish to know how long the
     corrections took once the error was discovered. That is, they wish to know the
     start and end times of the correction activity (<code>ex:correct</code>).
     These details are expressed as follows, showing that the corrections took a
     little over a day.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:correct prov:startedAtTime &quot;2012-03-31T09:21:00&quot;^^xsd:dateTime ;

     Time is visualized as additional information regarding activities or the
     links between activities and entities or agents.

    <p>
     Before noticing anything wrong with the government data, Betty had already
     posted a blog entry about the article. The blog entry had its own published
     provenance, stating that it quoted from the article.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:blogEntry a prov:Entity ;
             prov:wasQuotedFrom ex:article .</pre>
    <p>
     The newspaper, from past experience, anticipated that there could be revisions
     to the article, and so created identifiers for both the article in general
     (<code>ex:article</code>) as a URI that got redirected to the first version of the article (<code>ex:articleV1</code>),
     allowing both to be referred to as entities in provenance data. 
     In the provenance records, the newspaper describes the connection between the two: that
     the first version of the article is a specialization of the article in general.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:articleV1 prov:specializationOf ex:article .</pre>
    <p>
     Later, after the data set is corrected and the new chart generated, a new version
     of the article is created, <code>ex:articleV2</code>, with its own URI where the article
     is redirected to.  To ensure that those
     consulting the provenance of <code>ex:articleV2</code> understand that it
     is connected with the provenance of <code>ex:article</code> and <code>ex:articleV1</code>,
     the newspaper describes how these entities are related.
    </p>
    <pre class="turtle example">ex:articleV2 prov:specializationOf ex:article .
ex:articleV2 prov:alternateOf      ex:articleV1 .</pre>

     Roles are not declared directly in PROV, rather they are attributes of
