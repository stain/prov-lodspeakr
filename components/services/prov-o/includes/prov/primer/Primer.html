    This document provides an intuitive introduction and guide to the
    PROV specification for provenance on the Web. PROV is a core data model for
    provenance for building representations of the entities, people and
    processes involved in producing a piece of data or thing in the world.
    This primer explains the fundamental PROV concepts and provides examples 
    of its use.  The primer is intended as a starting point for those wishing
    to create or use PROV data.

   <h4>PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
   The PROV family of specifications aims to define the various aspects that are necessary to achieve the vision of inter-operable
   interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.  
   The specifications are as follows.
   <ul>
    <li> PROV-PRIMER, a primer for the PROV data model (this document),</li>
    <li> PROV-DM, the PROV data model for provenance,</li>
    <li> PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS, a set of constraints applying to the PROV data model,</li>
    <li> PROV-N, a notation for provenance aimed at human consumption,</li>
    <li> PROV-O, the PROV ontology, an OWL-RL ontology allowing the mapping of PROV to RDF;</li>
    <li> PROV-AQ, the mechanisms for accessing and querying provenance; </li>
    <li> PROV-SEM, a formal semantics for the PROV data model.</li>
    <li> PROV-XML, an XML schema for the PROV data model.</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>How to read the PROV Family of Specifications</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>The primer is the entry point to PROV offering a pedagogical presentation of the provenance model.</li>
    <li>The Linked Data and Semantic Web community should focus on PROV-O defining PROV classes and properties specified in an OWL-RL ontology. For further details, PROV-DM and PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS specify the constraints applicable to the data model, and its interpretation. PROV-SEM provides a mathematical semantics.</li>
    <li>The XML community should focus on PROV-XML defining an XML schema for PROV-DM. Further details can also be found in PROV-DM, PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS, and PROV-SEM.</li>
    <li>Developers seeking to retrieve or publish provenance should focus of PROV-AQ.</li>
    <li>Readers seeking to implement other PROV serializations
     should focus on PROV-DM and PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS.  PROV-O, PROV-N, PROV-XML offer examples of mapping to RDF, text, and XML, respectively.</li>

  <section> 
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    This primer document provides an accessible introduction to the PROV 
    specification for provenance on the Web.  
    The <i>provenance</i> of digital objects represents their origins.  PROV is a 
    proposed specification to represent provenance records, 
    which contain <i>descriptions</i> of the entities 
    and activities involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing a 
    given object.
    For the remainder of this document, we use the term 'provenance' to refer also
    to records of provenance, except where the distinction is important for clarity.
    By knowing the provenance of an object, we can perceive how to
    how use it.  Provenance can be used for many purposes, such as 
    understanding how data was collected so it can be meaningfully used, determining 
    ownership and rights over an object, making judgments about information to 
    determine whether to trust it, verifying that the process and steps used to obtain a 
    result complies with given requirements, and reproducing how something was generated.
   </p>

   <p>
    As a specification for provenance, PROV accommodates all those different uses 
    of provenance.  Different people may have different perspectives on provenance, 
    and as a result different types of information might be captured in provenance records.
   <ul>
    <li>
     One perspective might focus on <i>agent-centered provenance</i>, that is, what entities 
     were involved in generating or manipulating the information in question.  For example, 
     in the provenance of a picture in a news article we might capture the photographer who 
     took it, the person that edited it, and the newspaper that published it.
    </li>
    <li>
     A second perspective 
     might focus on <i>object-centered provenance</i>, by tracing the origins of portions of a 
     document to other documents. An example is having a web page that was assembled from content
     from a news article, quotes of interviews with experts, and a chart that plots data from a 
     government agency.
    </li>
    <li>A third perspective one might take is on <i>process-centered provenance</i>, 
     capturing the actions and steps taken to generate the information in question.  For example, a 
     chart may have been generated by invoking a service to retrieve data from a database, then 
     extracting certain statistics from the data using some statistics package, and finally 
     processing these results with a graphing tool.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
   Provenance records are metadata.  There are other kinds of metadata that is 
   not provenance.  For example, the size of an image is metadata of 
   that image but it is not provenance.
   For general background on provenance, a 
   comprehensive overview of requirements, use cases, prior research, and proposed 
   vocabularies for provenance are available from the 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/XGR-prov/">Final Report of the W3C Provenance Incubator Group</a>.  
   That document contains three general scenarios 
   that may help identify the provenance aspects of planned applications and 
   help plan the design of a provenance system.
  </p>

  <p>
   This primer document aims to ease the adoption of the PROV specifications by providing:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>An intuitive explanation of how PROV models provenance. A detailed description of
    all the concepts and relations in the PROV Data Model is provided in [[PROV-DM]].</li>
   <li>A simple self-contained example that illustrates how to produce and use PROV assertions, highlighting how 
    to combine PROV with other popular vocabularies such as FOAF and Dublin Core.  A description
    of the formal PROV ontology (PROV-O) can be found in [[PROV-O]].</li>
   <li>Example snippets using a notation of PROV designed for human
    consumption (PROV-N).  Details of this notation can be found at [[PROV-N]].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are additional reference documents for PROV that are not covered in this 
   primer, including the PROV Access and Query aspects of the specification (PROV-AQ), 
   the constraints on the PROV data model (PROV-DM-CONSTRAINTS), 
   a formal semantics of the PROV data model (PROV-SEM), and the PROV XML notation 
   (PROV-XML). </p>

  <h2>Intuitive overview of PROV</h2>

  <p>
   This section provides an intuitive explanation of the main concepts in PROV. 
   As with the rest of this document, it should be treated as a starting point for
   understanding the model. The PROV-DM data model document [[PROV-DM]]
   provides precise definitions and constraints to be used.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following diagram provides a high level overview of the structure of PROV records,
   limited to some key PROV concepts discussed in this document.
   The diagram is the same that appears in the [[PROV-DM]] document.
   Note that because PROV is meant to describe how things were created or delivered, 
   PROV relations are named so they can be used in assertions about the past.  
   This also affects the domain and range of the relations in PROV.

  <section>
   <h3>Entities</h3>

   <p>
    In PROV, physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of thing are called
    <i>entities</i>.
    Examples of such entities are a web page, a chart, and a spellchecker.
    Provenance records can describe the provenance of entities, and
    an entity‚Äôs provenance may refer to many other entities.  For example, a document D is
    an entity whose provenance refers to other entities such as a chart inserted into D,
    and the dataset that was used to create that chart.
    Entities may be described as having different attributes and
    be described from different perspectives.  For example,
    document D as stored in my file system, the second version of document D, 
    and D as an evolving document,
    are three distinct entities for which we may describe provenance.
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Activities</h3>

   <p>
    <i>Activities</i> are how entities come into 
    existence and how their attributes change to become new entities, 
    often making use of previously existing entities to achieve this. 
    They are
    dynamic aspects of the world, such as actions, processes, etc.
    For example, if the second version of document D was generated 
    by a translation from the first version of the document in another language,
    then this translation is an activity.
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Use and Generation</h3>
   <p>
    Activities <i>generate</i> new entities.
    For example, writing a document brings the document into existence, while
    revising the document brings a new version into existence.
    Generation does not always occur at the end of an activity, and an activity may generate entities
    part-way through.
    Activities also make <i>use</i> of entities. For example, revising a document
    to fix spelling mistakes uses the original version of the document as well
    as a list of corrections. 
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Agents and Responsibility</h3>
   <p>
    An <i>agent</i> takes a role in an activity such 
    that the agent can be assigned some degree of <i>responsibility</i> for the activity taking 
    place.
    An agent can be a person, a piece of software, an inanimate object, an organization, or
    other entities that may be ascribed responsibility.
    When an agent has some responsibility for an activity, PROV says the agent was
    <i>associated</i> with the activity, where several agents may be associated with
    an activity and vice-versa.
    Consider a chart displaying some statistics 
    regarding crime rates over time in a linear regression.  To represent the 
    provenance of that chart, we could state that the person who created the 
    chart was an agent involved in its creation, and that the software used to 
    create the chart was also an agent involved in that activity.
    An agent may be <i>acting on behalf</i> of others, e.g. an employee on behalf of their
    organization, and we can express such chains of responsibility in the provenance.
   </p>
   <p>
    We can also describe that an entity is <i>attributed</i> to an agent to express
    the agent's responsibility for that entity, possibly along with other agents.
    This description can be understood as a shorthand
    for saying that the agent was responsible for the activity which generated
    the entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    One may want to describe the provenance of an agent.  For example, an organization 
    responsible for the creation of a report may evolve over time as the report is written as
    some members leave and others join.  To make provenance assertions about an agent in PROV ,
    the agent must be declared explicitly both as an agent and as an entity.
   </p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Roles</h3>
   <p>
    A <i>role</i> is a description of the function or the part that an entity 
    played in an activity.  Roles specify
    the relationship between an entity and an activity, whether
    how an activity used an entity or generated an entity.  Roles also specify how agents are
    involved in an activity, qualifying their participation in the activity or
    specifying for what aspect of it each agent was responsible.
    For example, an agent may play the role of "editor" in an activity that uses
    one entity in the role of "document to be edited" and another in the role of
    "addition to be made to the document", to generate a further entity in the role of "edited document".
    Roles are application specific, so PROV does not define any particular roles.
   </p>
   <!--p>Roles are intended as an extension point in the model; it is expected users will define and use custom role taxonomies.  Role interpretation is application specific.</p -->
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Derivation and Revision</h3>
   <p>
    When one entity's existence, content, characteristics and so on are
    at least partly due to another entity, then we say that the former was
    <i>derived</i> from the latter. For example, one document may contain
    material copied from another, 
    and a chart was derived from the data that it illustrates.
   </p>
   <p>
    PROV allows some common, specialized kinds of derivation to be described.
    For example, a given entity, such as a document, may go through multiple <i>revisions</i> 
    over time. Between revisions,
    one or more attributes of the entity may change. 
    In PROV, the result of each revision is a new entity.
    PROV allows one to relate those entities by making a description that 
    one was a revision of another.
    Another specialized kind of derivation is to say that one entity, commonly
    a document, <i>quotes</i> from another.
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Plans</h3>
   <p>
    Activities may follow pre-defined procedures, such as recipes, tutorials, instructions, or workflows.
    PROV refers to these, in general, as <i>plans</i>, and allows the description that a plan was followed, by agents,
    in executing an activity.
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Time</h3>
   <p>
    Time is often a critical aspect of provenance.
    PROV allows the timing of significant events to be described, including
    when an entity was generated or used, or when an activity started
    and finished. For example, the model can be used to describe facts such as when a new
    version of a document was created (generation time), or when a document was
    edited (start and end of the editing activity).
   </p>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Alternate Entities and Specialization</h3>
   <p>
    Entities are defined in a flexible way in PROV, allowing for different
    perspectives to be taken as appropriate for the application. The following
    are examples illustrate this idea.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>The same entity can appear with different descriptions in a provenance record
     because each appearance emphasizes different aspects of the entity, e.g.
     a book may be described by its title in one place and by its author and publication date
     in another.</li>
    <li>The same entity can evolve over time into different 
     versions, e.g. a document that is repeatedly updated and has 
     subsequent releases over time.</li>
    <li>The same entity can be copied 
     or replicated, e.g. a document may be copied to several directories.</li>
    <li>An entity can go through different incarnations, e.g.
     a committee producing a report may have a set of members when the report 
     is first released and have a different set of members when an update of
     the report is released.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In all these situations, 
    the more specific entities (the versions, copies, incarnations) can be said in PROV to be <i>specializations</i>
    of the more general entity (the book, the document or the committee as a general entity).
    The specific entities in each example are also <i>alternates</i> of each other, as they are specializations
    of the same general entity.
    Being aware that two entities are alternates allows those
    consuming the PROV data to know that understanding the provenance of one entity is salient
    to understanding the provenance of the other.  Knowing that alternate entities are 
    specializations of another allows a consumer of PROV to refer to the general entity
    with a unique identifier even though it is specified as different alternates 
    throughout the provenance records.
   </p>

  <h2>Examples of Key Concepts in PROV</h2>

  <p>
   In the following sections, we show how PROV can be used to model 
   provenance in a specific example scenario. Samples of PROV data are given.
   These samples use the namespace prefix <b>prov</b> denotes 
   terms from the PROV ontology, while <b>ex</b> denotes terms specific to the example.
   We illustrate in these examples how PROV can be used in combination with other
   languages, such as FOAF and Dublin Core (with namespace prefix <b>foaf</b> and 
   <b>dcterms</b> respectively).
  </p>
  <p>
   The samples can be displayed in one or more of the following formats.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>[[PROV-O]] RDF triples, expressed using the [[TURTLE]] notation.</li>
   <li>[[PROV-N]] productions.</li>
  </ul>

   <h3>Entities</h3>

   <p>
    An online newspaper publishes an article with a chart about crime statistics making using of data (GovData) provided through a government portal. 
    The article includes a chart based on the data, with data values composed (aggregated) by
    geographical regions.
   </p>
   <p>
    A blogger, Betty, looking at the article, spots what she thinks to be an error in the chart.
    Betty retrieves a record of the provenance of the article, describing how it was created.
   </p>
   <p>Betty finds the following descriptions of entities in the provenance.</p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
  ex:article     a prov:Entity ;
                 dcterms:title "Crime rises in cities" .
  ex:dataset1    a prov:Entity .
  ex:regionList  a prov:Entity .
  ex:composition a prov:Entity .
  ex:chart1      a prov:Entity .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
  entity(ex:article, [dcterms:title="Crime rises in cities"])
  entity(ex:dataSet1)
  entity(ex:regionList)
  entity(ex:composition)
  entity(ex:chart1)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    These statements, in order, refer to the article (<code>ex:article</code>),
    an original data set (<code>ex:dataSet1</code>),
    a list of regions (<code>ex:regionList</code>), 
    data aggregated by region (<code>ex:composition</code>), 
    and a chart (<code>ex:chart1</code>), and state that each is an entity.
    Any entity may have attributes not specific to provenance, such as the title
    of the article, expressed using <code>dcterms:title</code> above.
   </p>
   <p>
    PROV data is commonly visualized for human consumption using particular conventions,
    which we will introduce over the following sections. To start with, entities
    are denoted using ovals, as shown below.
   </p>
   <img src="images/entities.png" alt="Visualization of the example entities"/>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Activities</h3>

   <p>
    Further, the provenance describes that there was
    an activity (<code>ex:compile</code>) denoting the compilation of the
    chart from the data set.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
  ex:compile a prov:Activity .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     activity(ex:compile)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    The provenance also includes reference to the more specific steps involved in this compilation,
    which are first composing the data by region (<code>ex:compose</code>) and then generating the
    chart graphic (<code>ex:illustrate</code>).
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose    a prov:Activity .

    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">

    <pre>
     activity(ex:compose)
     activity(ex:illustrate)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    In visualizations of the PROV data, activities are depicted as rectangles, as below.
   </p>

  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Use and Generation</h3>

   <p>
    Concluding the basic description of what occurred, the provenance 
    describes the key relations among the above
    entities and activities, i.e. the use of an entity by an activity,
    or the generation of an entity by an activity.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, the descriptions below state that the composition activity
    (<code>ex:compose</code>) used the original data set, that it used the list of
    regions, and that the composed data was generated by this activity.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose      prov:used           ex:dataSet1 ;
                     prov:used           ex:regionList .
     ex:composition  prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:compose .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     used(ex:compose, ex:dataSet1, -)
     used(ex:compose, ex:regionList, -)
     wasGeneratedBy(ex:composition, ex:compose, -)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Similarly, the chart graphic creation activity (<code>ex:illustrate</code>)
    used the composed data, and the chart was generated by this activity.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:illustrate prov:used           ex:composition .
     ex:chart1     prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:illustrate .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     used(ex:illustrate, ex:composition, -)
     wasGeneratedBy(ex:chart1, ex:illustrate, -)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    In visualizing the PROV data, usage and generation are connections between
    entities and activities.
   </p>
   <img src="images/use-generate.png" alt="Connection of the entities and activities by use and generation links"/>
  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Agents and Responsibility</h3>

   <p>
    Digging deeper, Betty wants to know who compiled the chart.
    Betty sees that Derek was involved in both the composition and
    chart creation activities:
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose    prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:derek .
     ex:illustrate prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:derek .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     wasAssociatedWith(ex:compose, ex:derek, -)
     wasAssociatedWith(ex:illustrate, ex:derek, -)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    The record for Derek provides the
    following description that
    Derek is an agent, specifically a person, followed by non-PROV information
    giving attributes of Derek.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:derek a prov:Agent ;
              a prov:Person ;
              foaf:givenName "Derek"^^xsd:string ;
              foaf:mbox      &lt;mailto:derek@example.org&gt; .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     agent(ex:derek, [ prov:type="prov:Person", foaf:givenName = "Derek", 
            foaf:mbox= "&lt;mailto:derek@example.org&gt;"])
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Derek works as part of an organization, Chart Generators Inc, and so the provenance
    declares that he acts on their behalf. Note that the organization is itself
    an agent.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:derek prov:actedOnBehalfOf ex:chartgen .
     ex:chartgen a prov:Agent ;
                 a prov:Organization ;
                 foaf:name "Chart Generators Inc" .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     agent(ex:chartgen, [ prov:type="prov:Organization",
            foaf:name = "Chart Generators Inc"])
     actedOnBehalfOf(ex:derek, ex:chartgen, ex:compose)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Finally, there is an explicit statement in the provenance that the chart was
    attributed to Derek.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:chart1 prov:wasAttributedTo ex:derek .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     wasAttributedTo(ex:chart1, ex:derek)
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>
    We can extend our graphical depiction to show the agents, association and attribution links.

  <section>
   <h3>Roles</h3>

   <p>
    For Betty to understand where the error lies, she needs to have more detailed 
    information on how entities have been used in and generated 
    by activities.  Betty has determined that <code>ex:compose</code> used 
    entities <code>ex:regionList</code> and <code>ex:dataSet1</code>, but she does not 
    know what function these entities played in the processing.  Betty 
    also knows that <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with the activities, but she does 
    not know if Derek was the analyst responsible for determining how the data 
    should be composed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The above information is described as roles in the provenance. The composition
    activity involved entities in four roles: the data to be composed (<code>ex:dataToCompose</code>),
    the regions to aggregate by (<code>ex:regionsToAggregateBy</code>), the
    resulting composed data (<code>ex:composedData</code>), and the
    analyst doing the composition (<code>ex:analyst</code>).
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:dataToCompose        a prov:Role .
     ex:regionsToAggregateBy a prov:Role .
     ex:composedData         a prov:Role .
     ex:analyst              a prov:Role .
    </pre>
    <p>
     Examples in the sections above show descriptions of the simple facts that the
     composition activity used, generated and was enacted by entities/agents.
     For example, the usage of the data set by the compose activity is expressed
     as follows.
    </p>
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose prov:used ex:dataSet1 .
    </pre>
    <p>     
     The
     provenance can contain more details of exactly how these entities and agents
     were involved in the activity. 
     To express this, PROV-O refers to <i>qualified usage</i>, <i>qualified generation</i>, etc.,
     which are descriptions consisting of several statements about how use, generation, etc. took place.
     For example, we may describe the plan followed by an agent in performing an activity, or
     the time at which an activity generated an entity, both illustrated later.
     Another example of qualified involvement is the role an entity played in an activity.
     The descriptions below state
     that the composition activity (<code>ex:compose</code>) included the usage
     of the government data set (<code>ex:dataSet1</code>) in the role of the data
     to be composed (<code>ex:dataToCompose</code>).
    </p>
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose prov:qualifiedUsage [
                   a prov:Usage ;
                   prov:entity  ex:dataSet1 ;
                   prov:hadRole ex:dataToCompose 
     ] .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <p>
     In PROV-N, the role is expressed as one of the list of attributes in the used
     expression, with the attribute name <code>prov:role</code>.
    </p>
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     used(ex:compose, ex:dataSet1,   -, [ prov:role = "ex:dataToCompose"])
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    This can then be distinguished from the same activity's usage of the list of
    regions because the roles played are different.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose prov:qualifiedUsage [
                   a prov:Usage ;
                   prov:entity  ex:regionList ;
                   prov:hadRole ex:regionsToAggregateBy
     ] .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     used(ex:compose, ex:regionList, -, [ prov:role = "ex:regionsToAggregateBy"])
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Similarly, the provenance includes descriptions that the same activity was
    enacted in a particular way by Derek, so it indicates that he had the role of 
    <code>ex:analyst</code>, and that the entity <code>ex:composition</code> took the role of the composed
    data in what the activity generated:
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:compose  prov:qualifiedAssociation [
                   a  prov:Association ;
                   prov:agent    ex:derek ;
                   prov:hadRole  ex:analyst
     ] .
     ex:composition prov:qualifiedGeneration [
                        a prov:Generation ;
                        prov:activity  ex:compose ;
                        prov:hadRole   ex:composedData
     ] .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     wasAssociatedWith(ex:compose, ex:derek, -, [ prov:role = "ex:analyst"])
     wasGeneratedBy(ex:composition, ex:compose, -, [ prov:role = "ex:composedData"])
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Depicting the above visually, we have the following.

   <h3>Derivation and Revision</h3>

   <p>
    After looking at the detail of the compilation activity, there appears
    to be nothing wrong, so Betty concludes the error is in the government dataset. 
    She looks at the dataset <code>ex:dataSet1</code>, 
    and sees that it is missing data from one of the zipcodes in the area.  She contacts
    the government agency, and a new version of GovData is created, declared to be the
    next revision of the data. The provenance of this new dataset,
    <code>ex:dataSet2</code>, states that it is a revision of the
    old data set, <code>ex:dataSet1</code>.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:dataSet2 a prov:Entity ;
                 prov:wasRevisionOf ex:dataSet1 .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     entity(ex:dataSet2)
     wasRevisionOf(ex:dataSet2, ex:dataSet1, -)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Derek notices that there is a new dataset available and creates a new chart based on the revised data, 
    using another compilation activity. Betty checks the article again at a
    later point, and wants to know if it is based on the old or new GovData.
    She sees a new description stating that the new chart is derived from the new dataset.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>

   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">

    <pre>
     wasDerivedFrom(ex:chart2, ex:dataSet2)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>and that the new chart is a revision of the original one:
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>

    Derivation and revision are connections between entities, and so depicted
    with arrows in our visualization.

  </section>

  <section>
   <h3>Plans</h3>

   <p>
    Betty then wishes to know whether the new data set correctly addresses
    the error that existed before. The provenance of the new dataset,
    <code>ex:dataSet2</code>, describes not only who performed the corrections,
    Edith, but also what instructions she followed in doing so (in PROV terms, the plan).
    First, the correction activity (<code>ex:correct</code>), the person who corrected
    it, Edith (<code>ex:edith</code>), and the correction instructions (<code>ex:instructions</code>)
    are described.
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:correct      a prov:Activity .
     ex:edith        a prov:Agent, prov:Person .
     ex:instructions a prov:Plan .

   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">

     entity(ex:instructions)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <p>
     The connection between them is expressed in PROV-O using a qualified association giving details of
     how Edith was associated with the correction activity,
     including that she followed the above correction instructions.
    </p>
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:correct prov:qualifiedAssociation [

   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">

  <section>
   <h3>Time</h3>

   <p>
    The government agency that produced GovData is concerned to know how long
    the incorrect chart was in circulation before the corrected chart was created.
    That is, they wish to compare the times at which the original and the corrected
    charts were generated. Time of generation is expressed in PROV-O using a qualified
    description of the generation. The snippet below shows that the second chart
    was generated roughly a month after the first.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:chart1 prov:qualifiedGeneration [
                    a prov:Generation ;
                    prov:activity ex:compile ;

                    a prov:Generation ;
                    prov:activity ex:compile2 ;
                    prov:atTime   "2012-04-01T15:21:00"^^xsd:dateTime

     wasGeneratedBy(ex:chart2, ex:compile2, 2012-04-01T15:21:00)
    </pre>
   </div>

   <p>
    To ensure their procedures are efficient, the agency also wish to know how long the
    corrections took once the error was discovered. That is, they wish to know the
    start and end times of the correction activity (<code>ex:correct</code>).
    These details are expressed as follows, showing that the corrections took a
    little over a day.

   <h3>Alternate Entities and Specialization</h3>

   <p>
    Before noticing anything wrong with the government data, Betty had already
    posted a blog entry about the article. The blog entry had its own published
    provenance, stating that it quoted from the article.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:blogEntry a prov:Entity ;
                  prov:wasQuotedFrom ex:article .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     entity(ex:blogEntry)
     wasQuotedFrom(ex:blogEntry, ex:article)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    The newspaper, from past experience, anticipated that there could be revisions
    to the article, and so created identifiers for both the article in general
    (<code>ex:article</code>) as a URI that got redirected to the first version of the article (<code>ex:articleV1</code>),
    allowing both to be referred to as entities in provenance data. 
    In the provenance records, the newspaper describes the connection between the two: that
    the first version of the article is a specialization of the article in general.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:articleV1 prov:specializationOf ex:article .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     entity(ex:articleV1)
     specializationOf(ex:articleV1, ex:article)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Later, after the data set is corrected and the new chart generated, a new version
    of the article is created, <code>ex:articleV2</code>, with its own URI where the article
    is redirected to.  To ensure that those
    consulting the provenance of <code>ex:articleV2</code> understand that it
    is connected with the provenance of <code>ex:article</code> and <code>ex:articleV1</code>,
    the newspaper describes how these entities are related.
   </p>
   <div class="turtle example">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>Turtle Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     ex:articleV2 prov:specializationOf ex:article .
     ex:articleV2 prov:alternateOf      ex:articleV1 .
    </pre>
   </div>
   <div class="provn example" style="display:none">
    <div class="exampleheader">
     <span class="exampleheader"><b>PROV-N Example</b></span></div>
    <pre>
     specializationOf(ex:articleV2, ex:article)
     alternateOf(ex:articleV1, ex:articleV2)
    </pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    Specialization and alternate relations connect entities, and so are visualized
    as links between them.

    The set of provenance records above could be grouped into one or multiple bundles.
    We visualize the whole example as a single bundle below.
