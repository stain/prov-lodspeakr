# EntityInvolvement is intended to be an 'abstract' subclass of Involvement 
# for Involvements that reference an entity. It is a superclass for concrete Involvements 
# (e.g. Usage, Derivation, Source) 

# It is not recommended that the type EntityInvolvement be used without also declaring
# one of its concrete subclasses.

# By definition, all instances of prov:Usage are also instances of prov:EntityInvolvement.
