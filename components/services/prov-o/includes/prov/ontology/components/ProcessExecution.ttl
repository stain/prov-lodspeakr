   rdfs:comment "A process execution expression is not an entity expression. Indeed, an entity expression represents a thing that exists in full at any point in its characterization interval, persists during this interval, and preserves the characteristics that makes it identifiable. Alternatively, an activity in something that happens, unfolds or develops through time, but is typically not identifiable by the characteristics it exhibits at any point during its duration.";
