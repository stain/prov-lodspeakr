# As I've argued before, I would prefer to go even further and say that
# not just attributes but all *assertions* (including provenance
# assertions) about an entity are potentially characterising. For
# example, the assertion that DocV2 was generated by EditingPE1 is not

#:doc_v2
#   prov:
# an attribute of DocV2, but does distinguish it from all other entities
# (including Doc and DocV1). As a querier or different asserter, I can
# use the wasGeneratedBy assertion to know whether the entity is what
# I'm looking for/want to assert about, no differently to if I'd
# searched for attribute-value pairs. There is no reason this argument
# would apply to only provenance assertions like wasGeneratedBy and not
# assertions about an entity more generally.

# Thanks,
