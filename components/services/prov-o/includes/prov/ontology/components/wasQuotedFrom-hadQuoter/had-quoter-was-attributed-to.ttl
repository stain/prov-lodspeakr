# Here we can't go fully back to wasQuotedFrom in PROV-N as we don't know which
# agent performed the quotation or was attributed to the (part of) the entity
# that we quoted. So we can only say:

# wasQuotedFrom(ex:paragraph, ex:blogpost)

# From this argument, wasQuotedFrom should not have the agent parameters in
# PROV-DM.  However, saying that *you* quoted *someone* saying *something*
# are common attributes of quotation in everyday use.
