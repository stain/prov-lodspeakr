""" Issue: If two sculptors collaborate on creating a human figurine statue entity e1: sculptor A by PE pe1 creates the arms and legs of e1 and sculptor B by PE pe2 creates the head and upper-body part of e1 then both pe1 and pe2 create e1. They may or may not be synchronized. How can we infer that pe1 = pe2 (whether in one account or across accounts)?
  

I think you've articulated well the case that A and B create different parts.  If they do this at different times, you will have
statue without head, statue with head without leg, statue with head with leg.

The constrained with accounts on generation-unicity is enforcing some structure in the provenance records, so that if really pe1<>pe2, then
they should generate the statue in different records.""";
