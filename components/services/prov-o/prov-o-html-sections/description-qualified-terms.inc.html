	  	<h3>Qualified Terms</h3>
        <p>        
This section shows how qualified relationships in prov-dm are encoded in provo. We need two diagrams: one to show the hierarchical relationship between involvement classes, and another to using Association as an exemplar to illustrate the general pattern to qualify a binary relationship.

         <p>
         We have in the current provo HTML document a diagram about qualified involvement in Section 8 “Overview of Qualified Involvement”, but we don’t think that such a diagram is great. We need to illustrate the hierarchy of involvements and some, not necessarily all, the associated object properties. The focus in the diagram will be on the elements of prov-dm that are illustrates in the previous overview sub-section. 
         The diagram can show the following kinds on involvements, and shows some (not necessarily all) the properties that link them together, e.g., entity, activity, agent, qualified. Note that, not all the sub-classes of involvements are included here; they will appear in section 3.3 because they are additional terms in prov-o.

         Turtle + Explanation. We do not to cover all the kinds of involvement and properties in the example. We only show how Derivation, Usage, Generation and Association can be expressed using this reification pattern. If need be, examples of other types of involvement should be given in section 4, where they are defined.  For the qualified relationships we provide the following example files:
