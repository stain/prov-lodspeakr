       <h3>Qualified Terms</h3>
       <p>The classes and properties in the Qualified terms category are for users who wish to provide additional details about the relationships between entities, activities, and agents. The terms in this category are the result of applying the <strong>Qualification Pattern</strong> to the simple relations available in the <a href="#prov-starting-point-owl-properties-at-a-glance">Starting Point</a> and <a href="#prov-expanded-owl-properties-at-a-glance">Expanded</a> categories.
      </p>
      <p>For example, Figure 2 illustrates the classes and properties needed to fulfill the qualification pattern for the <a class="qname" href="#used">prov:used</a> and <a class="qname" href="#wasAssociatedWith">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a> properties. While <a class="qname" href="#qualifiedUsage">prov:qualifiedUsage</a>, <a class="qname" href="#Usage">prov:Usage</a>, and <a class="qname" href="#entity">prov:entity</a> are used to qualify <span class="repeated">prov:used</span> relations, <a class="qname" href="#qualifiedAssociation">prov:qualifiedAssociation</a>, <a class="qname" href="#Association">prov:Association</a>, and <a class="qname" href="#agent">prov:agent</a> are used to qualify <span class="repeated">prov:wasAssociatedWith</span> relations. This pattern applies to the twelve other relations that can be qualified.
      </p>
      <p>In the example, the <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedUsage</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:used</span> property, and references an instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Usage</span> that provides attributes of the <span class="repeated">prov:used</span> relation between the Activity and Entity. The <span class="repeated">prov:entity</span> property is used to cite the Entity that was used by the Activity. In this case, the time that the Activity used the Entity is provided using the <span class="repeated">prov:atTime</span> property and a literal <span class="repeated">xsd:dateTime</span> value.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, the <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedAssociation</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:wasAssociatedWith</span> property, and references an instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Association</span> that provides attributes of the <span class="repeated">prov:wasAssociatedWith</span> relation between the Activity and Agent. The <span class="repeated">prov:agent</span> property is used to cite the Agent that was involved in the Activity. In this case, the plan that the Agent used is provided using the <span class="repeated">prov:hadPlan</span> property and an instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Plan</span>.
      </p>

            <div class="figcaption">Figure 2. An illustration of the qualification pattern applied to the Starting Point properties <a class="qname" href="#used">prov:used</a> and <a class="qname" href="#wasAssociatedWith">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a>.</div>

      <p>The following two examples show the result of applying the Usage and Association patterns to the chart making example from <a href=#description-starting-point-terms>Section 3.1</a>.
      </p>
       <div class="exampleOuter">
          <div><b>Qualified Usage</b></div>
            <p>The <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedUsage</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:used</span> property to provide an additional description to <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>. The instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Usage</span> cites the data used (<code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>) and the time the activity used it (2011-07-14T03:03:03Z).
          </p>
             <pre class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-qualified-usage.ttl" %}</pre>
       </div>

        <div class="exampleOuter">
           <div><b>Qualified Association</b></div>
            <p>The <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedAssociation</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:wasAssociatedWith</span> property to provide an additional description to <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>. The instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Association</span> cites the agent (<code>ex:derek</code>) that followed the instructions (<code>ex:tutorial_blog</code>).
            </p>
              <pre class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-qualified-association.ttl" %}</pre>
       </div>

      <div id="qualifed-forms-starting-point" style="padding: 20px">
         <p>Usage and Association (described above) are accompanied by six other qualifications of Starting Point relations. The <a href="#qualifed-forms-starting-point">following table</a> lists the simple relations that can be qualified, along with the qualification property, qualification class, and the property used to indicate the object of the qualified relation.

         <p>Six relations from the Expanded category can also be qualified.

       <p>This section finishes with two more examples of qualification as applied to the chart making example from <a href=#description-starting-point-terms>Section 3.1</a>.
       </p>

        <div class="exampleOuter">
           <div><b>Qualified Generation</b></div>
            <p>The <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedGeneration</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:wasGeneratedBy</span> property to provide an additional description to <code>ex:chart1</code>. The instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Generation</span> cites the time (2011-07-14T15:52:14Z) that the activity (<code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>) generated the chart (<code>ex:chart1</code>).

            <p>The <span class="repeated">prov:qualifiedDerivation</span> property parallels the <span class="repeated">prov:wasDerivedFrom</span> property to provide an additional description to <code>ex:chart1</code>. The instance of <span class="repeated">prov:Derivation</span> cites the activity (<code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>) and the Usages and Generations that the activity conduced to create the chart (<code>ex:chart1</code>).
