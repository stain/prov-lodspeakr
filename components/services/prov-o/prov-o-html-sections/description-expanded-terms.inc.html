	  	<h3>Expanded Terms</h3>
        <!-- *****Initial comments*****
This section presents the rest of classes and properties textually 
without using a diagram. We may use some examples in English. 
The classes and properties covered in this section are: 
Note, hasAnnotation, tracedTo, wasRevisionOf, hadOriginalSource, 
wasQuotatedFrom, hadQuotatedAgent, hadQuoterAgent, wasSummaryOf, 
alternateOf, terms related to Collection? Bundle? Role?? , hadRole, 
Location??, hadLocation?, wasStartedByActivity?? specializationOf?
DanielG: I'd say that hadRole, hadLocation, collection, bundle, location, alternate, specialization should not be here.

        <p>This section defines additional terms to describe provenance at a greater level of specificity (for example, <a href="#Person" class="qname">prov:Person</a> or <a href="#SoftwareAgent" class="qname">prov:SoftwareAgent</a> in place of <a href="#Agent" class="qname">prov:Agent</a>) and with more details (for example, <a href="#Location" class="qname">prov:Location</a> to describe address of a <a href="#Organization" class="qname">prov:Organization</a>). In addition, the new terms in this section facilitate modeling of common provenance assertions related to web resources. For example, different version of a web page can be represented using the <a href="#wasRevisionOf" class="qname">prov:wasRevisionOf</a> property and the <a href="#hadOriginalSource" class="qname">prov:hadOriginalSource</a> property can be used to reference the original source of information used in a web resource. Many of the properties introduced in this section are also "shortcut" notations for combining the PROV-O terms introduced in Section 3.1 "Starting Point Terms", which make it easier for provenance annotation of a resource.
