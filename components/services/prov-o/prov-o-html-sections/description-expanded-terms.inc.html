	  	<h3>Expanded Terms</h3>
        <!-- *****Initial comments*****
This section presents the rest of classes and properties textually 
without using a diagram. We may use some examples in English. 
The classes and properties covered in this section are: 
Note, hasAnnotation, tracedTo, wasRevisionOf, hadOriginalSource, 
wasQuotatedFrom, hadQuotatedAgent, hadQuoterAgent, wasSummaryOf, 
alternateOf, terms related to Collection? Bundle? Role?? , hadRole, 
Location??, hadLocation?, wasStartedByActivity?? specializationOf?
DanielG: I'd say that hadRole, hadLocation, collection, bundle, location, alternate, specialization should not be here.

        <p>This section defines additional terms to describe provenance at a greater level of specificity (for example, prov:Person or prov:SoftwareAgent in place of prov:Agent) and with more details (for example, prov:Location to describe address of a prov:Organization). In addition, the new terms in this section facilitate modeling of common provenance assertions related to web resources. For example, different version of a web page can be represented using the prov:wasRevisionOf property and the prov:hadOriginalSource property can be used to reference the original source of information used in a web resource. Many of the properties introduced in this section are also "shortcut" notations for combining the PROV-O terms introduced in Section 3.1 "Starting Point Terms", which make it easier for provenance annotation of a resource.
