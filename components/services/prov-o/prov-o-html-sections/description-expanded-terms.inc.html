        <p>        
         Terms for expressing <strong>expanded relationships</strong>, are for users who want to express more detailed provenance, in a more precise manner.For exampl
e, instead of simply stating that one entity was derived from another one, one can specify more specifically that one actually was a revision of, source of, or quotation
of the other entity.
