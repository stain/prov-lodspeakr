	  	<h3>Expanded Terms</h3>

      <p>The terms introduced in this section provide additional ways to describe the provenance among Entities, Activities, and Agents. 
         The additional terms are illustrated in the following figure and can be separated into five different categories.</p>

      <div id="expanded-terms-figure" style="text-align: center;" class="figure">
            <!-- When publishing to w3c: replace prov-o-diagrams/ with diagrams/ -->
            <!--img src="prov-o-diagrams/Starting-points-terms.png"-->
            <img src="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/tip/ontology/diagram-history/2012-05-03/expanded.svg"
                 style="width: 60%; min-width: 25em; max-width: 60em" 
                 alt="PROV-O Starting Point terms"/>
            <div class="figcaption"><a href="#expanded-terms-figure">Figure 3</a>. The expanded terms build upon those in the Starting Points section. <br/>
            The domain of <a href="#atLocation">prov:atLocation</a> (<span class="repeated">prov:Activity</span> or <span class="repeated">prov:Entity</span> or <span class="repeated">prov:Agent</span> or <span class="repeated">prov:InstantaneousEvent</span>) is not illustrated.</div>
      </div>


	  <p>The <strong>first</strong> category extends the <a href="#description-starting-point-terms">Starting Point terms</a> with subclasses, subproperties, and one superproperty.</p>

     <p>Three subclasses of Agent (<a href="#Person" class="qname">prov:Person</a>, <a href="#Organization" class="qname">prov:Organization</a>, and 
      <a href="#SoftwareAgent" class="qname">prov:SoftwareAgent</a>) and
      two subclasses of Entity are provided (<a href="#Collection" class="qname">prov:Collection</a>, and <a href="#Bundle" class="qname">prov:Bundle</a>). 
      </p>

      <p>
      A <span class="repeated">prov:Collection</span> is an Entity that provides a structure (e.g. set, list, etc.) to some constituents (which are themselves Entities). 
      The <span class="repeated">prov:Collection</span> class can be used to express the provenance of the collection itself: 
      e.g. who maintains the collection (attribution), which members it contains as it evolves, and how it was assembled. 
      The <a href="#hadMember" class="qname">prov:hadMember</a> property is used to assert membership in a collection.
      </p>

      <div id="description-bundle">
         <p>
         A <span class="repeated">prov:Bundle</span> is a named set of provenance descriptions that enables the expression of provenance of provenance.
         It is important to note that the set of provenance descriptions can assume forms beyond PROV-O triples, such as videotaped testimony or scribbles on a drink napkin. 
         The subclass of Bundle that contains PROV-O assertions is not provided by PROV-O, since it is more appropriate to do so using other recommendations, 
         standards, or technologies. In any case, a Bundle of PROV-O assertions is an abstract set of RDF triples, and adding or removing a triple creates a distinct 
         Bundle of PROV-O assertions.
         </p>
      </div>

	  <p>More general and more specific properties are also provided by the expanded terms. More generally, the property <a href="#wasInfluencedBy" class="qname">prov:wasInfluencedBy</a> is a superproperty that relates any influenced Entity, Activity, or Agent to any other influencing Entity, Activity, or Agent that had an effect on its characteristics. 
        More specifically, three subproperties of <span class="repeated">prov:wasDerivedFrom</span> are provided for certain kinds of derivation among Entities: 
      <a href="#wasQuotedFrom" class="qname">prov:wasQuotedFrom</a> cites a potentially larger Entity (such as a book, blog, or image) from which a new Entity was created
      by repeating some or all of the original, 
      <a href="#wasRevisionOf" class="qname">prov:wasRevisionOf</a> indicates that the derived Entity contains substantial content from the original Entity 
      (e.g., two editions of a book), and 
      <a href="#hadPrimarySource" class="qname">prov:hadPrimarySource</a> cites an older Entity produced by some agent with direct experience and 
      knowledge about the topic (such as a reading from a sensor, or a journal written during an historical event). 
      </p>
	  
	  <p>The <strong>second</strong> category relates Entities according to their levels of abstraction, where some Entities may present more specific aspects than their more general counterparts. 
      While <a href="#specializationOf" class="qname">prov:specializationOf</a> links a more specific Entity to a more general one (e.g., today's BBC news home page versus BBC's news home page on any day), <a href="#alternateOf" class="qname">prov:alternateOf</a> links Entities that present aspects of the same thing, but not necessarily the same aspects or at the same time (e.g., the serialization of a document in different formats).
    <a href="#mentionOf" class="qname">prov:mentionOf</a> is a special type of <span class="repeated">prov:specializationOf</span> whose subject presents as an aspect a particular <span class="repeated">prov:Bundle</span> in which its more general Entity was described (<a href="#asInBundle" class="qname">prov:asInBundle</a> is used to cite the Bundle in which the generalization was mentioned).
	  </p>
	  
      <div class="note">
      <p>The <span class="repeated">prov:mentionOf</span> and <span class="repeated">prov:asInBundle</span> properties are "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#cfi">at risk</a>" and may be removed from this specification based on feedback. Please send feedback to public-prov-comments@w3.org.</p>

      <p>These two properties are used to encode the PROV-DM's <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/prov-dm.html#term-mention">Mention construct</a>, which might be removed from PROV if implementation experience reveals problems with supporting this construct. 
      </div>

      <p>
      The <strong>third</strong> category allows further description of Entities. The property <a href="#value" class="qname">prov:value</a> holds a literal value for the Entity. For example, the <span class="repeated">prov:value</span> of a quote could be a string of the sentences stated, or the <span class="repeated">prov:value</span> of an Entity involved in a numeric calculation could be the xsd:integer four.
		 The property <a href="#atLocation" class="qname">prov:atLocation</a> can be used to describe the <a href="#Location" class="qname">prov:Location</a> of any 
      Entity, Activity, Agent, or <a href="#InstantaneousEvent" class="qname">prov:InstantaneousEvent</a> 
      (i.e., generation, usage, or invalidation of an entity and the starting or ending of an activity). 
      The properties used to describe instances of <span class="repeated">prov:Location</span> are outside the scope of PROV-O; 
      reuse of other existing vocabulary is encouraged.
		</p>

 
      <p>The <strong>fourth</strong> category describes the lifetime of an Entity beyond being <strong>generated</strong> by an Activity and <strong>used</strong> by other Activities. For example, a painting could not have been displayed before it was painted, and it could not be sold after it was destroyed by fire. 
      Similar to how Activities have start and end times, an Entity may be bound by points in time for which it was generated or is no longer usable. 
The properties <a href="#generatedAtTime" class="qname">prov:generatedAtTime</a> and <a href="#invalidatedAtTime" class="qname">prov:invalidatedAtTime</a> can be used to bound the starting and ending moments of an Entity's existence. The Activities that led to the generation or invalidation of an Entity can be provided using <span class="repeated">prov:wasGeneratedBy</span> and <a href="#wasInvalidatedBy" class="qname">prov:wasInvalidatedBy</a>, respectively. 
<a href="#generated" class="qname">prov:generated</a> and <a href="#invalidated" class="qname">prov:invalidated</a> are the inverses of <span class="repeated">prov:wasGeneratedBy</span> and <span class="repeated">prov:wasInvalidatedBy</span>, respectively, and are defined to facilitate Activity-centric in addition to Entity-centric modeling. 
      </p>

      <p>The <strong>fifth</strong> category describes the lifetime of an Activity beyond its start and end times and predecessor Activities.  
      Activities may also be started or ended by Entities, which are described using the properties <a href="#wasStartedBy" class="qname">prov:wasStartedBy</a> and <a href="#wasEndedBy" class="qname">prov:wasEndedBy</a>, respectively. Since Entities may start or end Activities, and Agents may be Entities, then Agents may also start or end Activities.

		   Agent <code>ex:derek</code>, acting again on behalf of the <code>ex:chartgenerators</code> organization, 
		   publishes a post about his recent changes to the aggregated file (<code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>) using the tool <code>ex:postEditor</code>. Since he is the one who started and ended the publishing activity (<code>ex:publicationActivity1123</code>), that information
		   is recorded as well. The post produced by <code>ex:derek</code> (<code>ex:post9821v1</code>) includes a permanent link where the content of the latest version is shown
		   (<code>ex:more-crime-happens-in-cities</code>) plus a snapshot of the content of the current version (<code>ex:postContent0</code>). Derek also adds additional metadata of the post, like the title.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		   However, shortly after having published the post, Derek detects a typo. He does not want to record the activity that led to the new version, so he just creates a new version and 
		   summarizes the changes in a revision of the original post (<code>ex:post9821v2</code>). This revision is also a specialization of the original post, since it is a refined version. 
         Thus, the permalink to the latest version (<code>ex:more-crime-happens-in-cities</code>) remains the same in the new revision, but a different URL is given for its snapshot (<code>ex:postContent1</code>).

           <p>Shortly after Derek's post publication, ex:monica adapts the text for a wider audience in a new post (<code>ex:post9822</code>). This version is a specialization of the original post,

		   automatically publish it in different <a href="#Bundle" class="qname">prov:Bundle</a>s (<code>ex:bundlePost and ex:bundlePost1</code>).

		   <p>
		   Agent <code>ex:John</code> also names the URI of the original source (<code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>). All the provenance statements related to his post
		   are grouped in a new <span class="repeated">prov:Bundle</span> (<code>ex:bundlePost2</code>).
		   
		   Unfortunately, there is a problem in the servers where <code>:post19201</code> is being stored, and all the data related to the post is lost. Thus, the system
