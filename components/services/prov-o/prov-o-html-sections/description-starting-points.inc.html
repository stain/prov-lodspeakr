      The classes and properties that constitute the starting-point terms of provo are illustrated in Figure 1.

          <p>
         There are three starting point classes in provo: Entity, Activity and Agent.  
         </p>


         <ul>
         <li>
         Entity: Entities are things that one wants to provide provenance for. 
         </li>
         <li>
         Activity: Entities are acted upon using activities. An activity is 
         characterized by a start and end time. It may use one or more entities, 
         and may generate one or more entities.
         </li>
         <li>
         Agent: An agent is a sub-class of Entity that is associated with an 
         activity. An agent bears some form of responsibility for the activity 
         taking place. Note also that an agent may act on behalf of another 
         agent.
         </li>
         </ul> 

         <p>
         Entities are related to each other using derivation, which is used to 
         specify that the creation/existence of an entity was influenced in some 
         way by the consumption of another entity. 
         An entity can be attributed to an agent to specify that the entity was 
         generated by some activity that the agent in question was associated 
         with.
         </p>

         <p>
         Activities may depend on each other. provo distinguishes between two 
         kinds of dependencies which are specified using the properties 
         wasInformedBy and wasStartedBy. 
         The first is used to specify that an activity used an entity that was 
         generated by another activity, and the second is used to specify that an
          activity was started or triggered by another activity.

         <p>
         Here is a basic example that shows how  the above starting-point terms 
         can be used to describe provenance information specifying how some 
         government data about crime statistics, ex:dataset1, was processed to 
         generate a graphical chart, ex:chart1 that depicts the statistics in 
         ex:dataset1 according to national regions.
         </p> 

        <div class="anexample">
           <div><b>Example</b></div>
            <p>
Turtle + Explanation. The example does not have to illustrate all the terms. Instead, it focuses on the main ones. (see eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl). We chose this example over others because we think it is simple, intuitive. Moreover, it is used in the primer, and therefore people who read the primer before the provo HTML document, will find it easy to follow.

            </p>
           <div class="exampleOuter">
              <pre class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl" %}</pre>
           </div>
        </div>

      <p>The example states that the agent ex:derek was associated with two 
      activities: ex:aggregationActivity and ex:illustrationActivity. The 
      activity ex:aggregationActivity used 
      the entity ex:datasets, representing a crime statistics dataset, and the
       entity ex:regionList, which is a list of national regions, and 
      generated a new entity, ex:aggregate1, that aggregates the statistics in
       ex:dataset1 according to the regions in ex:regionList. The entity 
      ex:aggregate&gt; was then used by the ex:IllustrationActivity activity, 
      which generated a new entity, ex:chart1, a chart that depicts the 
      statistics in ex:aggregate1.
      </p>

      <p> The example also states that the activity ex:illustrationActivity was 
      informed by the activity ex:aggregationActivity. Indeed, the former used
       the entity ex:aggregate1, which was generated by the latter.
      </p>

      <p> Because the agent ex:derek was associated with the activities 
      ex:aggregationActivity and ex:illustrationActivity, the entities 
      generated by these activities, i.e., ex:aggregate1 and ex:chart1, were 
      attributed to him.
      </p>

      <p> Finally, the example states that the agent ex:derek  acted on behalf of the organization ex:chartgen.
