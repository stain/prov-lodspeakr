	  	<h3>Starting Point Terms</h3>
       <p>The Starting Point category is a small collection of classes and properties that can be used to create simple, initial provenance descriptions.
         Three classes provide a basis for the rest of PROV-O:  
         <ul>
            <li> <a href="#Entity">prov:Entity</a>: An entity is a thing one wants to provide provenance for. Things can be physical, digital, conceptual, or otherwise.
            </li>
            <li> <a href="#Activity">prov:Activity</a>: An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities. This action can take multiple forms: consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, generating, etc.
            </li>
            <li> <a href="#Agent">prov:Agent</a>: An agent bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place. Further, an agent may act on behalf of another agent when involved with an activity.
            </li>
         </ul> 
      These three classes and the properties that relate them are illustrated in the following figure. 
      </p>

         <p>
         Entities are related to each other using derivation, which is used to 
         specify that the creation/existence of an entity was influenced in some 
         way by the consumption of another entity. 
         An entity can be attributed to an agent to specify that the entity was 
         generated by some activity that the agent in question was associated 
         with.
         </p>

         <p>
         Activities may depend on each other. PROV-O distinguishes between two 
         kinds of dependencies which are specified using the properties 
         wasInformedBy and wasStartedBy. 
         The first is used to specify that an activity used an entity that was 
         generated by another activity, and the second is used to specify that an
          activity was started or triggered by another activity. 
         </p>

        <div class="exampleOuter">
           <p>The following PROV-O describes the resources involved when creating a chart about crime statistics. The example uses only Starting Point terms and serves as a basis for elaboration that will be described in subsequent sections. In the example, Derek performs an aggregation of some government crime data, grouping by national regions that are described in a separate dataset by a civil action group.
           </p> 
           <pre class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl" %}</pre>
        </div>

      <p>The example states that the agent <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with two 
      activities: <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>. The 
      activity <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> used 
      the entities <code>ex:crimeData</code> (a crime statistics dataset) and <code>ex:nationalRegionsList</code> (a list of national regions), and 
      generated a new entity, <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>, that aggregates the statistics in
       <code>ex:crimeData</code> according to the regions in <code>ex:nationalRegionsList</code>. 
      The <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code> entity was then used by the <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code> activity, 
      to generate a new entity <code>ex:chart1</code> that depicts the aggregated statistics.
      </p>

      <p> The example also states that the activity <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code> was 
      informed by the activity <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code>. Indeed, the former used
       the entity <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>, which was generated by the latter.
      </p>

      <p> Because the agent <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with the activities 
      <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>, the entities 
      generated by these activities, i.e., <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code> and <code>ex:chart1</code>, were 
      attributed to him.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, the example states that the agent <code>ex:derek</code> acted on behalf of the organization <code>ex:chartgen</code>.
      </p>
